## Overview

<CompDetails name={componentName} />

The `ns-skyline` displays high-level messages to the user. Its position is always beneath the global navigation and above any content. Use it for notifications of important site-wide (not page-specific) events that may affect the experience of using the British Gas website.

Use `ns-skyline` for either of these two purposes:
- **Informational**
Show helpful information the user may want to be made aware of, e.g. upcoming price changes.
- **Warning**
Warn users of potential upcoming or current issues, e.g. a weather warning.

### Examples

<ExampleViewer type="standard" />

## Guidance

:::do
- Position `<ns-skyline>` directly underneath [`<nsx-header>`](/components/nsx-header).
- Communicate the message as clearly and concisely as possible. Ideally, it should be possible to explain the heading in just one sentence.
- Use inline links to support content and enable the user to find helpful information.
- Add the `icon` that matches the context of the message - either `warning` or `info`.
:::

:::dont
- Include a link in the heading.
- Use for error messaging.
- Use it for page-specific messages.
- Use it for messages that are not important.
- Make the message longer than necessary.

### Standard

The skyline contains the [`<ns-expander>`](/components/ns-expander). We recommend to use 1 expander, with a maximum of 2.

#### Key

| Key | Field type | Guidelines |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| <span class="marker">A</span> | Icon | This is an optional icon. It can be either an information or warning icon depending on the type of message you wish to display. |
| <span class="marker">B</span> | Heading | The heading to the anonymous content. When the heading is clicked the component opens to reveal the content. The recommended length is between 4 and 12 words, not exceeding 50 characters in total. |
| <span class="marker">C</span> | Anonymous slot | A single, short paragraph works best. Include emphasis with `<strong>`, inline links `<a>`. |
