## Guidance

:::do
- Use if you need to support the label with an image.
- Use if you need to support the label with an illustration.
- Use a heading within the content when providing supporting copy.
- Use inline text links into supporting content if necessary.
- Use a radio button or checkbox.
- Use expanders if you need to include more details.
- Use paragraph for description when using illustration.
:::

:::dont
- Mix radio and checkboxes.
- Use if the image or illustration make the selection harder to understand.
- Add too much content, they should not be miniature web pages.
- Use imagery within `ns-selector` with copy embedded inside.
- Use an image and an illustration together.
- Add a decoration behind the selectors.
- Use more than 5 expanders on a selector.

#### Key

| Key | Field type | Guidelines |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| <span class="marker">A</span> | Label | The label should describe the selection being made using the most concise content possible. The recommended length is 21 characters maximum. |
| <span class="marker">B</span> | Heading | A heading provides further description to the label. The recommended length is between 4 and 12 words, not exceeding 50 characters in total. |
| <span class="marker">C</span> | Paragraph  | The paragraph is mandatory when using with illustration. The illustration should be used purely as decorative in ns-selector and it doesn't come with an alternative description for assistive technology like screen readers. The paragraph should provide information to make the selector more accessible. The recommended length is 1 concise paragraph or 5 short bullet points, not exceeding 125 characters in total. Can contain bold copy `<b>`, inline links `<a>`, lists `<ul>` `<ol>`, and a caveat at the end of the relevant paragraph if required `<a href="#caveat">1</a>`. |
| <span class="marker">D</span> | Decoration | Use to support and highlight the content. [See illustrations](/guidelines/assets/#illustrations). |
| <span class="marker">E</span> | Keyline | An optional colour keyline can be added to distinguish and draw attention to your selectors. |
| <span class="marker">F</span> | Pill | You can use a pill to promote an option that has something special like a discount, a promotion or a because it's eco-friendly. Use the pill the `h3` and the list. Try not to add a pill to each option as it may lose its attention grabbing power. |
| <span class="marker">G</span> | Expanders | An optional addition of an [ns-expander](/components/ns-expander) component within the selector allows for more detail to be discoverable. It consists of a heading and an anonymous content slot. When the heading is clicked the component opens to reveal the content. When in an open state, clicking the heading will hide the content.
