## Guidance

:::do
- Use an `image` or a `decoration` to support the label.  
- Use a heading within the content when providing supporting text.
- Use inline text links within supporting content if necessary.
- Use a `radio` button or `checkbox`.
- Use a [`<ns-expander>`](/components/ns-expander) if there's a need to include more details.
- Use a description when using a `decoration` (illustration).
:::

:::dont
- Mix `radio` with `checkbox` types.
- Use it if the `image` or `decoration` makes the selection more difficult to understand.
- Add too much content - keep things concise.
- Use images that contain embedded text.
- Use an `image` and a `decoration` together.
- Exceed five expanders on a `<ns-selector>`.

#### Key

| Key | Field type | Guidelines |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| <span class="marker">A</span> | Label | Describe the selection concisely. It should not exceed 24 characters. |
| <span class="marker">B</span> | Heading | A heading provides further description to the label. The recommended length is between 4 and 12 words, not exceeding 50 characters in total. |
| <span class="marker">C</span> | Paragraph | A single, short paragraph followed by an unordered list work best. The text length should not exceed one paragraph and a ticked list of 3 to 5 items.

| <span class="marker">F</span> | Pill | You can use a pill to promote an option that has something special like a discount, a promotion or a because it's eco-friendly. Use the pill the `h3` and the list. Try not to add a pill to each option as it may lose its attention grabbing power. |
| <span class="marker">G</span> | Expanders | An optional addition of an [ns-expander](/components/ns-expander) component within the selector allows for more detail to be discoverable. It consists of a heading and an anonymous content slot. When the heading is clicked the component opens to reveal the content. When in an open state, clicking the heading will hide the content.
