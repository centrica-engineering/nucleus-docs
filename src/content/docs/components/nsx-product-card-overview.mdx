## Overview

<CompDetails name={componentName} />

### Examples

<ExampleViewer type="standard" />

## Guidance

:::do
- Use `pricing` attribute to set price in product cards.
- Use `price-heading` attribute to set price heading in product cards.
- Use `ns-content` for `content` slot to add subheading and description of the overview component.
:::

:::dont
- Use `price` slot in each product card.
- Use `price-heading` slot in each product card.
:::

Wrap the overview component in `ns-panel` and use its `decoration` attribute for decoration. It is possible to use any [decoration](./ns-panel#specification) for ns-panel. However we recommend to use **only** `grey-light` decoration for better accessibility of the contents inside the overview component.

```html
<ns-panel decoration="grey-light">
  <nsx-product-card-overview></nsx-product-card-overview>
</ns-panel>
```
### With Excess

When `excess` property of the overview component is set with an array of price options, the excess prices are displayed as radio options in the overview component. When a user selects a radio option, an `excess-change` event is dispatched from the overview component. The consuming wrapper component has to listen for the event and sets the updated ns-product-card prices back in the `pricing` attribute of the component.

```html
<nsx-product-card-overview excess="[60,0]" pricing='[{"monthly": {"now": 1200},"annually": 14400,"excess": 90}]' price-heading="Estimated Price"></nsx-product-card-overview>
```

### Without Excess

```html
<nsx-product-card-overview pricing='[{"monthly": {"now": 1200},"annually": 14400,"excess": 90}]' price-heading="Estimated Price"></nsx-product-card-overview>
```

### Was / Now Pricing

To display the price offer of a product in the overview component, `was / now` option in `monthly` pricing can be used to display the original and current price. The `was` price is displayed with `Was` prefix and a strikethrough in the price. The `now` price is displayed with `Now` prefix, when accompanied with `was` price. The `was` price is optional whereas `now` price is mandatory. `was / now` option can be used with / without Excess pricing.

```html
<nsx-product-card-overview pricing='[{"monthly": {"was": 1200,"now": 1000},"annually": 14400,"excess": 90}]' price-heading="Estimated Price"></nsx-product-card-overview>
```

### With Monthly Now Primary/Secondary

To allow a display of a special offer which requires the `now` price to have two different values you can supply it with the following shape:

```javascript
now: {
  'primary-prefix': null,
  'primary-price': 500,
  'primary-extra': 'for the first 3 months',
  'secondary-price': 1000,
  'secondary-prefix': 'Then'
}
```

```html
<nsx-product-card-overview pricing='[{"monthly": {"was": null, "now": {"primary-price": 500, "primary-extra": "for the first 3 months", "secondary-price": 1000, "secondary-prefix": "Then"} }, "excess": 60}]' price-heading="Estimated Price"></nsx-product-card-overview>
```
