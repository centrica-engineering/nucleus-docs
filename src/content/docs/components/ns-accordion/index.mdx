`<ns-accordion>` (would be nicer larger like Shoelace DS?)

## Purpose
**Accordion enables users to expand and collapse multiple sections of content.** 

(**Question:** can the above be automated separately from that in the example from wrapper below?)
We use accordions to break down content into meaningful sections, helping to reduce information overload. Accordions are useful for things like frequently asked questions or displaying multiple blocks of related content inside an [ns-expander](components/ns-expander.md).

## Example

import Wrapper from '../../../../components/wrapper.astro';

<Wrapper name="ns-accordion">
</Wrapper>
