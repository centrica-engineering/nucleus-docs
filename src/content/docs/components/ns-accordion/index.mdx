    ## Type Purposes

    ### Image location options
     What would be the right structure?

    #### Github:
    This is an exmaple of an image hosted on GitHub:
     `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/withastro/docs/main/public/default-og-image.png`

    ![An illustration of planets and stars featuring the word “astro”](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/withastro/docs/main/public/default-og-image.png)

    #### In the assets folder:
    This seems a long way away and needs untidy and prone to typos 4 x ../ on the link.
    `../../../../assets/images/ns-accordion/contentguidance-ns-accordion.webp`
    ![Assets located image](../../../../assets/images/ns-accordion/contentguidance-ns-accordion.webp)

    #### Closer together in components/images/ns-accordion folder: 
     This location is similar to the existing docs.
    `../images/ns-accordion/contentguidance-ns-accordion.webp`
     ![components/images/ns-accordion located image](../images/ns-accordion/contentguidance-ns-accordion.webp)

    #### In the same folder components/ns-accordion/images:
    Third possible way could be to include even closer in the components/ns-accordion folder alongside the .md files. I was concerned this might then appear in the right hand side links for 'On this page' but it doesn't. So this would be my preferred option I think as it's right next to the doc md files using this image. 
    `./images/contentguidance-ns-accordion.webp`
    ![components/ns-accordion/images located image](./images/contentguidance-ns-accordion.webp)

    @Drew - I know you mentioned that it needed to work in GitHub too. Do you have an example path? I put the one in first, above but not sure if that's what you meant? It would make sense to me if the images are stored in docs alongside the mds.
