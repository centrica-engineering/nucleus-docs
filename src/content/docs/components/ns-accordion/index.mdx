import Wrapper from '../../../../components/wrapper.astro';

<Wrapper name="ns-accordion" >

    ## Type Purposes

    This is an exmaple of an image hosted on GitHub:

    ![An illustration of planets and stars featuring the word “astro”](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/withastro/docs/main/public/default-og-image.png)

    This is using relative path - could this be the right structure? Current docs have images in components/images/ns-accordion/contentguidance-ns-accordion.webp ...and Astro docs example shows images in the Assets folder...
    ../../assets/images/ns-accordion/contentguidance-ns-accordion.webp
