## Guidance

It would be a 'nice to have' if we can dynamically generate these with a tool-tip type explanation on selection - maybe something akin to what you are sometimes presented with as a tour on a newly installed software? Fallback/MVP will be to continue to use these existing image diagrams.

| Key | Field type | Guidelines |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| A | Heading | The recommended length is between 4 and 12 words, not exceeding 50 characters in total.  |
| B | Content | Use between 1 and 8 [ns-expander](components/ns-expander.md) components. All expanders need to be related to the accordion's heading.|

### Code snippets
