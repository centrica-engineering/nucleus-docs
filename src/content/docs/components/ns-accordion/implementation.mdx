export const componentName = "ns-accordion";
import Specification from '../../../../components/specification.astro';
import Placement from '../../../../components/placement.astro';

## Specification

<Specification name={componentName} />

### Heading

- The heading is for the entire accordion.
- Heading level should be h2 or h3 depending on its place in the semantics of the page.

### Anonymous

- Place ns-expanders into this slot.
- Check the [ns-expander documentation](/components/ns-expander) for more information.

## Component placement

<Placement name={componentName}/>

## Best practice

| ðŸ’š Do's | ðŸ’” Don'ts |
| :---  | :---  |
| Use for FAQs | Use a background with an accordion as the expanded state is white |
| Use to split up related content | Use more than 8 expanders |
| Make sure the heading relates to content | Use for critical or to hide information (such as caveats) |
| Use as a supporting component to the rest of the page's content | Use as a solution to excessive copy on a page |
|  | Use as the only component on a page |

### Considerations

If you need more than 8 [ns-expander](/components/ns-expander) components, you can use more than one accordion on the page.

If there isn't a inherent logical order to the expanders, use alphabetical order for ease of scanning.
