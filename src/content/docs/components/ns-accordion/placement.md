## Placement
### Where to use
The ns-accordion component can be used in the following components:

* [ns-panel](components/ns-panel.md)
* [ns-content](components/ns-content.md)
* ns-editorial (deprecated?)
* ns-column?

### Things to consider
Are you hiding content to improve the aesthetic of a page? Consider optimising your content or breaking across sections instead of hiding it in an accordion. etc.
