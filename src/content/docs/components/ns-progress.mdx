## Overview

<CompDetails name={componentName} />

### Examples

<ExampleViewer type="standard" />

## Guidance

:::do
- Use to indicate the progress of the journey.
- Use the `info` and `next` elements to describe only those steps.
- Keep `info` and `next` statements concise or leave them out if unnecessary or duplicating content.
- Keep `steps` to a minimum for perceived simplicity.
- Use up to 20 `steps`, but ideally no more than 10.
- Use decimal places to reduce the `number` of overall `steps`.
- Use JavaScript to dynamically update the component rather than re-adding to each page.
- Use the `complete` state on the confirmation page.
:::

:::dont
- Use to show anything other than progress, e.g. loading.
- Use questions for `info` and `next` statements - keep it informative.
- Arbitrarily leave out `info` text - instead, use an â€˜all or nothing' approach to the whole sequence.
- Nest as a sub-process within another `<ns-progress>`.
- Use less than two `steps`.
- Use more than one `<ns-progress>` on a page.
- Use the last step as the confirmation page.
