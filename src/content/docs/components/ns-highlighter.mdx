## Overview

<CompDetails name={componentName} />

The `ns-highlighter` communicates messages that a service may not be available or that there are technical issues on specific pages. These differ from global messages as they only apply to some pages and are not site-wide. e.g. A message that says the top-up service may not be available would only apply to pages that customers will look at to top up.

### Examples

<ExampleViewer type="standard" />

## Guidance

:::do
- Keep the messages concise.
- Choose the correct `state` to inform the user what type of message it is.
:::

:::dont
- Use for a generic message.
- Use it where a [Roadblock page type](/page-types/roadblock) would be more appropriate.
- Include additional headings.

#### Key

| Key | Field type | Guidelines |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| <span class="marker">A</span> | Icon | The icon is dictated by the [`type`](specification-attribute-type). |
| <span class="marker">B</span> | Heading | The recommended length is between 4 and 12 words, not exceeding 50 characters in total. |
| <span class="marker">C</span> | Anonymous slot | A single, short paragraph works best. The text length should not exceed two paragraphs of 3 lines. Include emphasis with `<strong>`, inline links `<a>`, lists `<ul>` `<ol>`. Add a [caveat link](/components/ns-caveat) if required. |
| <span class="marker">D</span> | Accent | This is to support the context of the messaging. This colour matches that of the icon. |
