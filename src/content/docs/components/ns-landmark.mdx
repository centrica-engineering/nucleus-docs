## Overview

<CompDetails name={componentName} />

Use landmarks to set the scene for what the page is for, what offers might be available and give helpful actions for users. It contains the main heading for the page and provides overarching context to the rest of the page.

:::updated
**28 November 2024**

Additional features for the `horizon` type have been added:

- The `state` attribute provides a choice of superflame graphics as a decoration
- The `sunrise` attribute allows for the image to not be anchored to the bottom of the landmark

Check those options in [the specification](#specification) down below!
:::

### Examples

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Standard">
    <ExampleViewer type="standard" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Summit">
  If the page purpose is promotional we recommend using `type="summit"`.
    <ExampleViewer type="summit" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Hillside">
  If you are designing a series of informative / educational pages that all follow a similar theme, it would be considered best practice to use the same coloured decoration within the `type="hillside"`.
    <ExampleViewer type="hillside" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Valley">
  If the page purpose is to showcase features and products, use `type="valley"`.
    <ExampleViewer type="valley" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Lakeside">
  If the page purpose is a 400 or 500 error page, use `type="lakeside"`.
    <ExampleViewer type="lakeside" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Horizon">
  If the page purpose is to match above-the-line marketing activity, use `type="horizon"`.
    <ExampleViewer type="horizon" />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Guidance

:::do
- Use it at the top of the page.
- Communicate the primary purpose clearly and concisely.
- Content must be relevant to the page.
- Use decoration/lifestyle photography only.
:::

:::dont
- Use it in the middle or end of a page.
- Always add a CTA (Call To Action) â€“ it may drive traffic away.
- Use it to hold random content - [`<ns-editorial>`](/components/ns-editorial) may be better to use for this.
- Hold any meaning in the image - it's a decoration.

### Considerations

- Use shorter, simpler words for more effective headings.
- For subheadings, aim for a length of 1 to 5 words.
- Ensure the message is in plain English and assists the user by providing an actionable link if possible.
- If the pageâ€™s purpose is to provide further information about a product or service, avoid including a Call to Action (CTA) within the landmark, as this can lead to users dropping out as they may click the CTA instead of reading the page to understand their next steps.
- The type of landmark used should be determined by the page type.

## Implementation

### Placement

<Placement name={componentName} />

### Specification

<Specification name={componentName} />

### Specification notes

#### `<ns-form>`

- A form is optional and recommended in scenarios where you need some information from the user to start a journey or dynamically change the content on the rest of the page.
- Don't use `ns-selector`, `ns-datepicker`, `nsx-address-selector`, or `nsx-marketing-consent` as these require more space than is available in the landmark.
- Keep forms short in `hillside` to avoid distorting and stretching the background decoration colour.
