## Overview

<CompDetails name={componentName} />

Use landmarks to set the scene for what the page is for, what offers might be available and give helpful actions for users. It contains the main heading for the page and provides overarching context to the rest of the page.

### Examples

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Standard">
    <ExampleViewer type="standard" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Summit">
  `type="summit"`
    <ExampleViewer type="summit" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Hillside">
  `type="hillside"`
    <ExampleViewer type="hillside" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Valley">
  `type="valley"`
    <ExampleViewer type="valley" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Lakeside">
  `type="lakeside"`
    <ExampleViewer type="lakeside" />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Guidance

:::do
- Use it at the top of the page.
- Communicate the primary purpose clearly and concisely.
- Content must be relevant to the page.
- Use decoration/lifestyle photography only.
:::

:::dont
- Use it in the middle or end of a page.
- Always add a CTA (Call To Action) – it may drive traffic away.
- Use it to hold random content - [`<ns-editorial>`](/components/ns-editorial) may be better to use for this.
- Hold any meaning in the image - it's a decoration.

### Considerations

- Shorter and simpler words tend to work better in the heading.
- The recommended copy length is between 1 and 5 words for the Sub heading.
- The message must be in plain English, and help the user out of the situation by providing an actionable link if possible.
- If the purpose of the page is to understand more about a product or service, then it is considered bad practice to include a CTA within the landmark, as users are likely to drop out. This is because users believe the next step is to click the CTA, rather than reading the page to get a better understanding of how they should proceed.
- Let the page type define the type of landmark you use.
- If the page purpose is to be informative / educational then we recommend using `hillside`.
  - If the page purpose is promotional we recommend using `summit`.
  - If the page purpose is a 400 or 500 error page, use `lakeside`.
  - If the page purpose is to showcase features and products, use `valley`.
  - If you are designing a series of informative / educational pages that all follow a similar theme, it would be considered best practice to use the same coloured decoration within the `hillside`.

## Implementation

### Placement

<Placement name={componentName} />

### Specification

<Specification name={componentName} />

### Notes

#### `slot="cta"`

- A CTA is optional and not recommended in scenarios where you want to encourage your user to explore content further down the page.
- If you need to include a CTA keep the text ‘short, relevant, and actionable’. It should not exceed more than 24 characters.

#### `<ns-form>`

- A form is optional and recommended in scenarios where you need some information from the user to start a journey or dynamically change the content on the rest of the page.
- Don't use `ns-selector`, `ns-datepicker`, `nsx-address-selector`, or `nsx-marketing-consent` as these require more space than is available in the landmark.
- Keep forms short in `hillside` to avoid distorting and stretching the gradient.
