## Overview

<CompDetails name={componentName} />

Landmarks are used to set the scene for what the page is for, what offers might be available and give helpful best next actions for users. This is where the main heading for the page will sit and give the overarching context to the rest of the page.

### Example

<ExampleViewer>
  <ExampleStandard slot="template" />

<ExampleViewer>
  <ExampleSummit slot="template" />

<ExampleViewer>
  <ExampleHillside slot="template" />

## Guidance

:::do
- Use it at the top of the page.
- Communicate the primary purpose in a clear and concise way.
- Content must be relevant to the page.
- Use decoration/lifestyle photography only.
:::

:::dont
- Use it in the middle or end of a page.
- Always add a cta (It'll drive traffic away).
- Use it to hold random content - `ns-editorial` may be better use for this.
- Hold any meaning in the image, it's a decoration.

### Summit

#### Key

| Key | Field type | Guidelines |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| A | Main Heading | The recommended length is between 4 and 12 words, not exceeding 50 characters in total. |
| B | Content | A single, short paragraph works best. Can contain bold copy `<b>`, inline links `<a>` and a caveat at the end of the relevant paragraph if required `<a href="#caveat">1</a>`. |
| C | Action | See action guidance below |
| D | Image path | This is the image that will be used inside `ns-landmark`. Ensure the important focus area of your image remains within the safe-area. It should have an aspect ratio of 16:9, the dimensions should be 1440x810 px, the file type should be jpg, and the file size should be no more than 150kb. Please make sure you work with a designer when selecting this image as finding the right one with the correct focus area can be challenging. **Note:** The image shouldn't hold any meaning and be only used as a decoration. This is why it doesn't have an `alt=""` attribute to avoid adding unnecessary content for users using assistive technology. |

| ðŸ’š Do | ðŸ’” Don't |
| :--- | :--- |
| Capture the moment. | Allow the card to cover important content. |
| Set focus of the photo correctly. | Obstruct people's faces with the card. |
| Convey activity related to topic. | Use images with a white background. |

| ðŸ’š Do | ðŸ’” Don't |
| :--- | :--- |
| Use the same colour for a set of pages on the same topic, e.g. Guide pages related to boilers. | Use the red decoration for something that is not a promotional promotional or an error-themed page. |
| Keep the content concise. |  |

### Valley

![](@assets/components/ns-landmark/guidance-valley.webp)

:::note
The purpose of the valley landmark is to present an overview of a product or service as a user moves down the funnel of their purchase journey. A CTA may be used, but is not recommended in scenarios where the objective is to encourage further on-page browsing.

#### Key

| Key | Field type | Guidelines |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| A | Main Heading | The recommended length is between 4 and 12 words, not exceeding 50 characters in total. |
| B | Content | Valley can accommodate multiple paragraph slots. However, be mindful of keeping it concise. To introduce a product or service we recommend 1 shot paragraph and three or four bullet point in a ticked list to showcase your key product benefits. It can contain bold copy `<b>`, inline links `<a>` and a caveat at the end of the relevant paragraph if required `<a href="#caveat">1</a>`. |
| C | Action | See action guidance below |
| D | Image path | This is the image that will be used inside `ns-landmark`.  It should have an aspect ratio of 4:3 or 16:9, the file type should be jpg, and the file size should be no more than 100kb. To see which image you can use - please see the Image Guidance section below. Don't use imagery with white backgrounds. Please make sure you work with a designer when selecting any imagery for the ns-landmark. **Note:** The image shouldn't hold any meaning and be only used as a decoration. This is why it doesn't have an `alt=""` attribute to avoid adding unnecessary content for users using assistive technology. |
| E | Decoration | Apply a colour to the offset. [The specification table](#specification) has a list of options. |

| ðŸ’š Do | ðŸ’” Don't |
| :--- | :--- |
| Use checked list to highlight your key product benefits | Add a CTA if the purpose of the page is for users to consume the content. |
| Use a complementary image to add context to your product or service | Use long, verbose content. Keep the user interested with a snappy overview and draw them down the page |
| Use colour, pill and ratio options for alternative aesthetics | Forget to use an image |

### Lakeside

![](@assets/components/ns-landmark/guidance-lakeside.webp)

#### Key

| Key | Field type | Guidelines |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| A | Main Heading | The recommended length is between 4 and 12 words, not exceeding 50 characters in total. |
| B | Content | Lakeside can accommodate multiple paragraph slots. However, be mindful of keeping it concise. Our guidance is a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 3. Can contain bold copy `<b>`, inline links `<a>` and a caveat at the end of the relevant paragraph if required `<a href="#caveat">1</a>`. |
| C | Action | See action guidance below |

| ðŸ’š Do | ðŸ’” Don't |
| :--- | :--- |
| Use more than one paragraph. | Use more than three paragraphs. |
| Display 400 and 500 error pages. | Use to build a page. |
| Get to the point, in this scenario the Sub heading and CTA have been omitted. |  |

### Considerations

- Shorter and simpler words tend to work better in the heading.
- The recommended copy length is between 1 and 5 words for the Sub heading.
- The message must be in plain English, and help the user out of the situation by providing an actionable link if possible.
- If the purpose of the page is to understand more about a product or service, then it is considered bad practice to include a CTA within the landmark, as users are likely to drop out. This is because users believe the next step is to click the CTA, rather than reading the page to get a better understanding of how they should proceed.
- Let the page type define the type of landmark you use.
- If the page purpose is to be informative / educational then we recommend using `hillside`.
  - If the page purpose is promotional we recommend using `summit`.
  - If the page purpose is a 400 or 500 error page, use `lakeside`.
  - If the page purpose is to showcase features and products, use `valley`.
  - If you are designing a series of informative / educational pages that all follow a similar theme, it would be considered best practice to use the same coloured decoration within the `hillside`.

#### `slot="cta"`

- A CTA is optional and not recommended in scenarios where you want to encourage your user to explore content further down the page.
- If you need to include a CTA keep the text â€˜short, relevant, and actionableâ€™. It should not exceed more than 24 characters.

#### `<ns-form>`

- A form is optional and recommended in scenarios where you need some information from the user to start a journey or dynamically change the content on the rest of the page.
- Don't use `ns-selector`, `ns-datepicker`, `nsx-address-selector`, or `nsx-marketing-consent` as these require more space than is available in the landmark.
- Keep forms short in `hillside` to avoid distorting and stretching the gradient.
