## Overview

<CompDetails name={componentName} />

The `ns-article` component is a container for long-form content such as blogs, editorials and support articles. Use it to split the content into easy-to-consume chapters or sections.

### Examples

<ExampleViewer type="standard" />

## Guidance

:::do
- Split `<ns-article>` into multiple easy-to-consume sections.
- Place all [`<ns-images>`](/components/ns-image) and [`<ns-videos>`](/components/ns-video) within `<figure>`.
- Prefer to use a `ratio` of `16 / 9`  for images and videos.
- Include contextual text links with content.
:::

:::dont
- Use for content that is not long-form.
- Use multiple `<ns-article>` instances to create page layouts.

#### Key

| Key | Field type | Guidelines |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| <span class="marker">A</span> | Heading | The recommended length is between 4 and 12 words, not exceeding 50 characters in total. |
| <span class="marker">B</span> | Media | Videos should be hosted on YouTube and have an aspect ratio of `16 / 9`. There is a choice of 2 image sizes: [720 x 405px](/guidelines/assets#720x405px) and [720 x 540px](/guidelines/assets#720x540px). Images should be WebP file type, the file size should be no more than 50kb. |
| <span class="marker">C</span> | Caption | Short contextual description of the video or image content. |
| <span class="marker">D</span> | Content | The content should be concise and use sub headings to introduce each piece. Divide content into short paragraphs as it is easier to consume, and aids effective page scanning. Content can contain bold copy `<b>` `<strong>`, inline links `<a>`, lists `<ul>` `<ol>`, and a caveat at the end of the relevant paragraph if required `<a href="#caveat">1</a>`. |
| <span class="marker">E</span> | CTA | Keep the text short, relevant, and actionable. It should not exceed 24 characters. |
