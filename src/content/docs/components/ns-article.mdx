#### Key

| Key | Field type | Guidelines |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| <span class="marker">A</span> | Heading | The recommended length is between 4 and 12 words, not exceeding 50 characters in total. |
| <span class="marker">B</span> | Media | Videos should be hosted on YouTube and have an aspect ratio of `16 / 9`. There is a choice of 2 image sizes: [720 x 405px](/guidelines/assets#720x405px) and [720 x 540px](/guidelines/assets#720x540px). Images should be WebP file type, the file size should be no more than 50kb. |
| <span class="marker">C</span> | Caption | Short contextual description of the video or image content. |

Divide content into short paragraphs as it is easier to consume, and aids effective page scanning. Content can contain bold copy `<b>` `<strong>`, inline links `<a>`, lists `<ul>` `<ol>`, and a caveat at the end of the relevant paragraph if required `<a href="#caveat">1</a>`. |
