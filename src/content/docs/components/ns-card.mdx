Cards are to be used to apply a container around a related grouping of information. Achieve this through a combination of imagery, illustrations and typography.

    </Tabs>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Flat">

## Guidance

:::do
- Use to direct customers to the actions.
- Embolden text in the paragraph that is important.
- Make the [CTA](/components/ns-cta) (Call To Action) wording unique, stating the action.
- Use [section cards](#section) to navigate users to primary actions.
- Consider using decoration in the panel to add emphasis to the cards.
:::

:::dont
- Mix different card types in a row.
- Have more than one CTA on a card.
- Repeat the CTA wording on each card.
- Use inline links in the paragraph.
- Use the section card without a decoration.
- Use in place of the [`<ns-product-card>`](/components/ns-product-card) component.

### Considerations

- Consider your CTA type and try to keep them consistent between rows across the cards, unless there is a need.
- There can be less than three cards in a row, but it should always use the triple layout. Always consider a lockup for this, before using the cards.
- Headings work best with one to four words.
- Please check the imagery guidelines when adding an image to the card.
- Be careful when using decoration in the panel with the section cards as the blue on blue with the CTA's will make them not accessible.
- There should always be a heading to the group of cards inside the panel.

## Implementation

### Placement

<Placement name={componentName} />

### Specification

<Specification name={componentName} />

### Notes

#### `slot="action"`

```html
<ns-card type="support" decoration="bulb">
  <h3 slot="heading">Get energy with us</h3>
  <p slot="paragraph">We've got a tariff to suit every home and family.</p>
  <div slot="action">
    <!-- action content ns-cta/ns-form -->
  </div>
</ns-card>
```

#### `<ns-pill>`

To add a `ns-pill` to the card it needs to be placed inside one of the slots. Be careful about using it within the heading slot, as the pill content will be read out as part of the heading for screen readers.

If you have a group of cards, try to make sure that the pill is placed in the same location throughout those cards. This will make improve the readability of the cards.

##### Screen readers with ns-pill

```html
<ns-card>
  <h3 slot="heading">
    <ns-pill>Special Offer</ns-pill>
    Get energy with us
  </h3>
  ...
</ns-card>
```

In the above example the screen reader will read out "Special Offer Get energy with us". Make sure that is what is expected. Remember the pill cannot be used on its own within a heading. Our advice is to rarely put pills in headings as they are normally conveying a message related to the heading, but is not heading content.

##### Pill over image

If using with a type of `support` with an image. There is also the option to place the pill over the image using the `pillOverImage` attribute. Note the `ns-pill` will need to be in the `paragraph` slot as it is no longer related to the heading.

```html
<ns-card type="support" image="path/to/image" pillOverImage>
  <h3 slot="heading">Get energy with us</h3>
  <p slot="paragraph">
    <ns-pill>Special Offer</ns-pill>
    ...
  </p>
  ...
</ns-card>
```

More details on how to use the ns-pill can be found on the [`<ns-pill>`](/components/ns-pill).
