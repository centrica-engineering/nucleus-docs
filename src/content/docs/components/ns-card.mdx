## Overview

<CompDetails name={componentName} />

Cards are to be used to apply a container around a related grouping of information. Achieve this through a combination of imagery, illustrations and typography.

:::updated
**8 September 2024**

Additional feature for an `inactive` state has been added:

- This feature is used to indicate that the card contains content that is inactive.
- The `inactive` state is applied to the card by adding the `inactive` attribute to the card element.

  <summary>Historical updates</summary>

  **28 August 2024**

  The card component has been simplified:

  - The `type="section"` card has been deprecated. The `type` will switch to `standard` when `section` is applied.
  - The standard card (with no `type=""`) now allows for options for image, decoration, and pill.
  - The `type="support"` type is now used for a better responsive behaviour for cards with images at `basketball-court` viewports.

## Guidance

:::do
- Use to group content that belongs together about a specific item, action, etc..
- Use to direct customers to the actions.
- Embolden text in the paragraph that is important.
- Make the [CTA](/components/ns-cta) (Call To Action) wording unique, stating the action.
- The visual in the image or illustration should be related to the content of the card
- Consider adding a [decoration](/components/ns-panel/#specification-attribute-decoration) to the panel to emphasise the cards.
- Use "support" type in a one-column layout at basketball-court when you have 3 elements in a row to avoid widow cards and empty spaces on small to medium viewports.
:::

:::dont
- Mix different card types in a row.
- Have more than one CTA on a card.
- Repeat the CTA wording on each card.
- Use support type cards in 2 column layouts at basketball (use standard cards or set layout to 1 column)
- Use in place of the [`<ns-product-card>`](/components/ns-product-card) component.

### Support
The support card has a responsive behaviour at basketball-court viewport, to enable a better layout for tablet-sized devices.

### Considerations

- Keep the type of CTA consistent across a group of cards.
- Always add heading to the group of cards inside the panel.
- Place the pill in the same location across the group of cards to improve the readability of the cards.

## Implementation

### Placement

<Placement name={componentName} />

### Specification

<Specification name={componentName} />

### Figma

<Figma name={componentName} />

## Accessibility

### `inactive`

The [`inactive`](#specification-attribute-inactive) attribute indicates that the card's content is inactive. The card will appear greyed-out to indicate this to a sighted user.

For a screen reader user the value of [`inactive-message`](#specification-attribute-inactive-message) provides context about why the content is inactive. This message will be read out by screen readers after announcing the heading. This `inactive-message` is hidden from sighted users.

### `<ns-pill>`

Be careful adding [`<ns-pill>`](/components/ns-pill) within the heading slot, as the content of the pill will be read out as part of the heading for screen readers.

In this example using Safari on a Mac with VoiceOver it will read out:

> Heading level 3, 2 items - Special Offer Get energy with us. You are currently on a heading level 3.

```html
<ns-card>
  <h3 slot="heading">
    <ns-pill>Special Offer</ns-pill>
    Get energy with us
  </h3>
  ...
</ns-card>
```

Make sure that is what is expected. Remember the pill cannot be used on its own within a heading.

Our advice is to rarely include pills in headings, as they typically convey a message related to the heading but are not part of the heading content itself.
