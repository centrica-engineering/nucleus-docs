import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

## Overview

<CompDetails name={componentName} />

Allows the user interface to split into multiple columns by defining the number of columns required at specific viewports.

Use for arranging components and content, not for gratuitous numerous columns as perhaps seen in a newspaper or magazine.

### Examples

<ExampleViewer type="standard" />

## Guidance

:::do
- Pick the number of columns to complement the content.
- Test the full responsive range of your page's and not just the defined viewports.
- Try to stick to one column as much as possible .
- Try to avoid having widowed items.
- Use the ratio options to add side panels.
:::

:::dont
- Have complicated column structures, try to simplify your content first.
- Use in components that are too small to support multiple components.
- Use to put components in columns that are designed to be standalone.
- Use to create newspaper style columns and layouts.

## Implementation

### Placement

<Placement name={componentName} />

### Specification

<Specification name={componentName} />

#### Specification notes

##### How do viewports inherit values?

Each value is applied at that viewpoint and each larger viewport unless the larger viewport has a column value applied.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="2 columns">
    Setting 2 columns for every viewport larger than basketball court.

    ```html
    <ns-column basketball-court="2"></ns-column>
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="1 to 3 columns">
    Going from 1 column to 3 columns at a larger viewport.

    ```
      <ns-column hockey-pitch="3"></ns-column>
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="2 viewports">
    Going from 1 to 2 columns and then 4 columns.

    ```
      <ns-column hockey-pitch="2" rugby-pitch="4"></ns-column>
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="3 viewports">
    Going from 2 columns, to 4 columns, and back down to 3 columns

    ```
      <ns-column basketball-court="2" rugby-pitch="4" polo-field="3"></ns-column>
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="ratios">
    Going from 1 columns to 2:1 columns and then 3:1 columns

    ```
      <ns-column hockey-pitch="2:1" polo-field="3:1"></ns-column>
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

##### How do the 2:1, 3:1 columns work?

Ratios are used in order to have different widths for the columns. The ratios can be `1:2`, `2:1`, `1:3` and `3:1`. The first value will be applied to the width of all odd child elements, and the second to all child even elements.

Considering the example of a `2:1` column, it essentially means that all odd child elements have a width of 2 and all even child elements have a width of 1.

The markup would look like:

```html
<ns-column hockey-pitch="2:1">
  <div>This will have width of 2</div>
  <div>This will have width of 1</div>
</ns-column>
```
