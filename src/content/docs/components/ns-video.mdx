### Cookie consent

To comply with user privacy preferences `ns-video` includes a cookie consent feature.

It checks if the user has accepted 'Targeting Cookies' before enabling video playback. If not, the video remains inactive, and a message prompts the user to enable 'Targeting Cookies' and refresh the page.

Alternatively, users can watch the video on YouTube.
