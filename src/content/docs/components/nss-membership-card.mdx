## Overview

**The purpose of the membership card is to provide details of a single offer or benefit exclusively for a particular customer.**

<CompDetails name={componentName} />

It is specific to the ‘membership wallet’ and has been designed to utilise the membership styling and colours that set it apart from standard ns-cards. It provides members with the feeling that these discounts are in their wallet, ready to be used.

### Examples

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Standard">
    <Tabs>
      <TabItem label="Standard">  
      </TabItem>
      <TabItem label="with scheme">
      </TabItem>
    </Tabs>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
