## Overview

**The purpose of the membership card is to provide details of a single offer or benefit exclusively for a particular customer.**

<CompDetails name={componentName} />

The snowflake `nss-membership-card` is specific to the 'membership wallet'. It utilises the membership styling and colour scheme that sets it apart from `ns-card`.

### Examples

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Standard">
    <Tabs>
      <TabItem label="Membership scheme">
      </TabItem>
      <TabItem label="Navy scheme">
      </TabItem>
    </Tabs>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Guidance

:::do

- Use specifically for membership.
- Choose from the available colours for a membership card.
- Use illustrations or images.
- Carefully consider content and how it will display across different viewports.

:::

:::dont

- Use excessively long content.
- Try to use additional colours that are not part of the membership scheming.
- Repetitively use images on adjacant cards as it harms the recognition factor.
