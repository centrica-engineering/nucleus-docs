## Overview

<CompDetails name={componentName} />

The timeline gives an overview of a process and can show the progression of a customer journey. Its purpose is to create situational awareness for the user and manage expectations.

### Examples
<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Standard">
    <ExampleViewer type="standard" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Step">
    <ExampleViewer type="step" />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Guidance

:::do
- Use a maximum of 10 steps.
- Consider if the timeline heading duplicates the page heading.
- Provide helpful messaging.
- Use `summary` and `show-step-count` to help set expectations for the `standard` type.
:::

:::dont
- Add too much detailed content.
- Use illustrations or icons within additional content.
- Use excessively long event names.
- Use the timestamp if it causes confusion with a date elsewhere on the page.
