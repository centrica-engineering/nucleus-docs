This component wraps the `ns-inputter`. Consider the guidelines defined for the `ns-inputter` when using this component. See [`<ns-inputter>`](/components/ns-inputter) documentation.

  <TabItem label="Standard">
    <ExampleViewer type="standard" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Confirm">
    <ExampleViewer type="confirm" />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
