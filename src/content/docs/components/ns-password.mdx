## Overview

<CompDetails name={componentName} />

The `ns-password` component includes a set of features that help users not only enter a password but also accommodate their need to create one.

This component wraps the `ns-inputter`. Consider the guidelines defined for the `ns-inputter` when using this component. See [`<ns-inputter>`](/components/ns-inputter) documentation.

### Examples

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Standard">
  Use the standard type to validate an existing password.
    <ExampleViewer type="standard" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Confirm">
  Use the `type="confirm"` attribute to verify that the password input matches the user’s intention when setting up a password.
    <ExampleViewer type="confirm" />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Guidance

:::do
- Use the correct `type` for the intended purpose.
- Ensure the requirements reflect what's needed.
- Add `helper` text and `tip-details` if necessary.
:::

:::dont
- Attempt to make up another version by using parts - it will lead to an inconsistent experience.
- Use requirements that differ from company policy.
