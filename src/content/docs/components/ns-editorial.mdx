## Overview

<CompDetails name={componentName} />

Sometimes, a more detailed explanation of something can be helpful â€“ without requiring the user to take immediate action. That is where the `ns-editorial` component can help.

### Examples

:::

:::dont
- Add images within the text content.
- Include a `text` or `direct` [`<ns-cta>`](/components/ns-cta).
- Use images with white backgrounds.
- Use images containing embedded text.

| <span class="marker">A</span> | Heading | The recommended length is between 4 and 12 words, not exceeding 50 characters in total. |
| <span class="marker">B</span> | Image | Use an image size of [480 x 360px](/guidelines/assets#480x360px). Images should be WebP file type, the file size should be no more than 25kb. |
