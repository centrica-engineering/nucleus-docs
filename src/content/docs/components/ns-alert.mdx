## Overview

<CompDetails name={componentName} />

:::caution
It has an ARIA role of `alert`, which brings the immediate attention of its content to the user. It should be used for its role and not for its look.

More information in the [Accessibility](#accessibility) section.
:::

### Example

<ExampleViewer>
  <ExampleStandard slot="template" />
</ExampleViewer>

#### Highlighter

`type="highlighter"`

##### Error

`state="error"`

For communicating failure with urgence. A task cannot be completed without the user remedying something.

<ExampleViewer>
  <ExampleHighlighterError slot="template" />
</ExampleViewer>

##### Info

`state="info"`

For communicating a useful piece of information that the user might find helpful to carry out their action.

<ExampleViewer>
  <ExampleHighlighterInfo slot="template" />
</ExampleViewer>

##### Success

`state="success"`

For communicating that an action has been successful.

<ExampleViewer>
  <ExampleHighlighterSuccess slot="template" />
</ExampleViewer>

##### Warning

`state="warning"`

Use for communicating a piece of information with less severity. These include foreseeable problematic events, failures, outages and how to avoid errors.

<ExampleViewer>
  <ExampleHighlighterWarning slot="template" />
</ExampleViewer>

## Guidance

:::do
- Keep the messages concise
- Use an icon to alert the user what type of message it is
:::

:::dont
- Use for generic message that is not in context to the page it is displayed in
- Use it for Roadblock error messaging
:::

### Highlighter

![](@assets/components/ns-alert/guidance-highlighter.webp)

#### Key

| Key | Field type | Guidelines |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| A | Icon | This is the icon inside the `highlighter` type. This is dictated by the `state` of Alert. The [specification table](#specification) has a list of options. |
| B | Heading | The recommended length is between 4 and 12 words, not exceeding 50 characters in total. |
| C | Content | A single, short paragraph works best. You are able to use inline text links within the paragraph if necessary. Don't add additional headings within the paragraph and the copy length should not exceed more than two paragraphs of 3 lines each. Can contain bold copy `<b>`, inline links `<a>`, and a caveat at the end of the relevant paragraph if required `<a href="#caveat">1</a>`. |
| D | Accent | This is to support the context of the messaging. This colour matches that of the icon. |

### Considerations

- Be clear and concise

The message must be in plain English, and help the user out of the situation by providing an actionable link if possible.

## Implementation

### Placement

<Placement name={componentName} />

### Specification

<Specification name={componentName} />

### Related links

<RelatedLinks name={componentName}>
- [ns-component](#!)
- [ns-component](#!)
</RelatedLinks>

## Accessibility

The information contained in the alert should always be the most important information on the page. To ensure that screen reader users are informed about the importance of these messages the content is read aloud as soon as the alert type is used. This could be when the page loads or when it is dynamically added to a page.

If there are multiple alerts on a page they are read:

- from top to bottom on page load
- in the order they have been added to the page when dynamically added
