#### Key

| Key | Field type | Guidelines |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| <span class="marker">A</span> | Icon | The icon is dictated by the [`state`](#specification-attribute-state). |
| <span class="marker">B</span> | Heading | The recommended length is between 4 and 12 words, not exceeding 50 characters in total. |
| <span class="marker">C</span> | Anonymous slot | A single, short paragraph works best. The text length should not exceed two paragraphs of 3 lines. Include emphasis with `<strong>`, inline links `<a>`, lists `<ul>` `<ol>`. Add a [caveat link](/components/ns-caveat) if required. |
| <span class="marker">D</span> | Accent | This is to support the context of the messaging. This colour matches that of the icon. |

### Considerations

- Be clear and concise

The message must be in plain English, and help the user out of the situation by providing an actionable link if possible.

## Implementation

### Placement

<Placement name={componentName} />

### Specification

<Specification name={componentName} />

## Accessibility

The information contained in the alert should always be the most important information on the page. To ensure that screen reader users are informed about the importance of these messages the content is read aloud as soon as the alert type is used. This could be when the page loads or when it is dynamically added to a page.

If there are multiple alerts on a page they are read:

- from top to bottom on page load
- in the order they have been added to the page when dynamically added
