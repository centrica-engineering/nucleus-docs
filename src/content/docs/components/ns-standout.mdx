## Overview

<CompDetails name={componentName} />

Use the `ns-standout` component to make information stand out from a page and to visually differentiate a concise block of text from the content that surrounds it, for example:

- Quotes (as in prices)
- Call-outs
- Examples
- Additional information about the page
- Emergency information

### Examples

<ExampleViewer type="standard" />

## Guidance

:::do
- Keep concise and to the point.
- Limit use to 1 or 2 per page.
- Use it to make information stand out.
- Select a colour border decoration that works with your design.
- Use a relevant, single text link if it is necessary.
- Use without an `<h2>` - `<h6>`.
- Use without a link.
- Ensure the information is relevant and important enough to stand out from the rest of the content.
:::

:::dont
- Fill with many paragraphs.
- Overuse it everywhere - it dilutes the impact.
- Use it in place of ns-alert or ns-card – they have a different purpose.
- Add icons, images or illustrations.
- Use the direct ns-cta (you should consider using ns-card instead for that purpose).
- Nest another ns-standout component within it.
- Use in a form where helper text is more appropriate.
- Use for warning or error messages.
