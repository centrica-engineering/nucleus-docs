## Overview

<CompDetails name={componentName} />

## Guidance

:::do
- Use for products.
- Use the same sections for all products in a group.
- Give multiple cards the same html parent.
- Use `role="list"` and `role="listitem"` when used in multiples.
:::

:::dont
- Use for other content types, use [`<ns-card>`](/components/ns-card) instead.
- Use in a form.
- Use different ratio images across a set of multiple cards.
- Overuse the keyline - its purpose is to make that card stand out from others.
