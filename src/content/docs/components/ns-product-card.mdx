## Guidance

:::do
- Use for products.
- Use the same sections for all products in a group.
- Use `role="list"` and `role="listitem"` when used in multiples.
- The horizontal type is suitable for wide and narrow content areas.
- Include an illustration to support and highlight the product in the horizontal type.
- Add a product image if it is beneficial.
- Add a pill to draw attention to a particular product in the horizontal type.
- Make a product card stand out by adding a keyline.
:::

:::dont
- Use for other content types - use [`<ns-card>`](/components/ns-card) instead.
- Use in a form.
- Use different ratio images across a set of multiple cards.
- Overuse the keyline - its purpose is to make one product card stand out from others.
