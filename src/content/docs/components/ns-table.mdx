## Overview

<CompDetails name={componentName} />

The table component consumes basic HTML table markup, which makes it accessible and responsive, as well as styling it.

### Examples

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Standard">
    <ExampleViewer type="standard" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Fixed column">
 For when it is useful for the first column to maintain its position while scrolling horizontally through the remainder of the table.
    <ExampleViewer type="standard-fixed-column" />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
