## Overview

<CompDetails name={componentName} />
The component is a small coloured highlight. Use `ns-pill` to highlight a small item of information to a customer. Within the British Gas experience, they are often used to attract attention to a promotional message or a notification. Only display a small detail of the content. The `ns-pill` component should not contain lengthy or complex information.

Pills can help to create a subtle sense of urgency or to draw a customerâ€™s attention to the value of a product or service. For example, use them to highlight the date a promotional offer expires or to feature a gift offer.

### Examples

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Standard">
    <ExampleViewer type="standard" />
  </TabItem>

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Caveat">
    <ExampleViewer type="standard-caveat" />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Guidance

:::do
- Use solid versions of icons.
- Use `<ns-pill>` sparingly, ideally one or two per journey maximum. (Less is more).
- Keep your copy short and simple for maximum impact.
- Use `<ns-pill>` in a component with a `direct` CTA (Call To Action).
- Choose colours that are consistent and relevant.
:::

:::dont
- Use as validation messages.
- Create distraction or put undue pressure on customers to purchase unwanted or irrelevant products by overusing urgency elements.
- Use pills near a `text` CTA. Pills should not detract the user's attention from their next action.
- Use in the middle of a sentence.
- Use the `<ns-pill>` as a link or button. (Caveat link excepted).
- Use icons that can make `<ns-pill>` visually appear like an interactive component, for example, an [`<ns-cta>`](/components/ns-cta) or drop-down [`<ns-inputter>` `select`](/components/ns-inputter).
- Use `<ns-pill>` as a heading.
