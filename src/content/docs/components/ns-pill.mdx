## Overview

<CompDetails name={componentName} />
The component is a small coloured highlight. Use `ns-pill` to highlight a small item of information to a customer. Within the British Gas experience, they are often used to attract attention to a promotional message or a notification. Only display a small detail of the content. The `ns-pill` component should not contain lengthy or complex information.

Pills can help to create a subtle sense of urgency or to draw a customer’s attention to the value of a product or service. For example, use them to highlight the date a promotional offer expires or to feature a gift offer.

### Examples

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Standard">
    <ExampleViewer type="standard" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Extended">
    <ExampleViewer type="standard" />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Guidance

:::do
- Use solid versions of icons.
- Use `ns-pill` very sparingly, ideally one or two per journey maximum. Less is more.
- Use a `yellow` pill to draw attention to an offer or promotional message.
- Use `red` and `lime` pills for dashboard notifications.
- Keep your copy short and simple for maximum impact.
- Use `ns-pill` in a component with a direct CTA.
- Choose colours that are consistent and relevant.
:::

:::dont
- Use as validation messages.
- Create a shouty experience by using `ns-pill` in multiple places. It dilutes the impact.
- Create distraction or put undue pressure on customers to purchase unwanted or irrelevant products by overusing urgency elements.
- Don’t use pills near a text CTA. Pills should not detract attention from your users’ next action.
- Use in the middle of a sentence.
- Use the `ns-pill` as a link or button. (Caveat link excepted).
- Use icons that can make `ns-pill` visually appear like an interactive component, for example an `ns-cta` or drop-down `ns-inputter/select`.
- Use `ns-pill` as a heading.
