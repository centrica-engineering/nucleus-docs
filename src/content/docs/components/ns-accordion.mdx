## Overview

<CompDetails name={componentName} />

Use `ns-accordion` to break down content into meaningful sections, helping to reduce information overload. Accordions can be useful for things like frequently asked questions or displaying multiple blocks of related content inside an `ns-expander`.

### Examples

<ExampleViewer type="standard" />

## Guidance

:::do
- Use for FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions).
- Use to split up related content.
- Make sure the heading relates to the content.
- Use as a supporting component to the rest of the page’s content.
:::

:::dont
- Use a background with an accordion – the expanded state is white.
- Use more than 8 expanders.
- Use to hide critical information (such as caveats).
- Use as a solution to excessive copy on a page.
- Use as the only component on a page.

### Standard

#### Key

| Key | Field type | Guidelines |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| <span class="marker">A</span> | Heading | The recommended length is between 4 and 12 words, not exceeding 50 characters in total. |
| <span class="marker">B</span> | Anonymous slot | Add 1 to 8 [`<ns-expander>`](/components/ns-expander) components. All expanders relate to the Heading. |

### Considerations

If you need more than 8 [ns-expander](/components/ns-expander) components, you can use more than one accordion on the page.

If there isn't a inherent logical order to the expanders, use alphabetical order for ease of scanning.

## Implementation

### Placement

<Placement name={componentName}/>

### Specification

<Specification name={componentName} />
