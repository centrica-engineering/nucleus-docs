| Key | Field type | Guidelines |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| A | Main Heading | The recommended length is between 4 and 12 words, not exceeding 50 characters in total. |
| B | Content | A single, short paragraph works best. Can contain bold copy `<b>`, inline links `<a>` and a caveat at the end of the relevant paragraph if required `<a href="#caveat">1</a>`. |
| C | Action | See action guidance below |
| D | Image path | This is the image that will be used inside `ns-landmark`. Ensure the important focus area of your image remains within the safe-area. It should have an aspect ratio of 16:9, the dimensions should be 1440x810 px, the file type should be jpg, and the file size should be no more than 150kb. Please make sure you work with a designer when selecting this image as finding the right one with the correct focus area can be challenging. **Note:** The image shouldn't hold any meaning and be only used as a decoration. This is why it doesn't have an `alt=""` attribute to avoid adding unnecessary content for users using assistive technology. |

## Action

### CTA

* A CTA is optional and not recommended in scenarios where you want to encourage your user to explore content further down the page.
* If you need to include a CTA keep the text ‘short, relevant, and actionable’. It should not exceed more than 24 characters.

### Form

* A form is optional and recommended in scenarios where you need some information from the user to start a journey or dynamically change the content on the rest of the page.
* Don't use `ns-selector`, `ns-datepicker`, `nsx-address-selector`, or `nsx-marketing-consent` as these require more space than is available in the landmark.
* Keep forms short in `hillside` to avoid distorting and stretching the gradient.
