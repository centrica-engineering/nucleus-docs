## Purpose

> **Landmarks are used to introduce the page, informing users of their current location and its primary purpose.**

Landmarks are used to set the scene for what the page is for, what offers might be available and give helpful best next actions for users. This is where the main heading for the page will sit and give the overarching context to the rest of the page.

## Example

<Wrapper name="ns-landmark">
  <ExampleStandard slot="template"/>
</Wrapper>
