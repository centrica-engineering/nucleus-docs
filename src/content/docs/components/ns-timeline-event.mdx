## Guidance

:::do
- Use text or [`<ns-card>`](/components/ns-card/) for additional content if required.
- Use either default, icon or number decoration for all events in the timeline sequence for the `standard` type [`<ns-timeline>`](/components/ns-timeline).
- Use either a number or fallback decoration for all events in the timeline sequence for the `step` type [`<ns-timeline>`](/components/ns-timeline).
:::

:::dont
- Add a status to an event for the `step` type.
- Mix two different decoration types in events.
- Use any icon type with names ending `solid` or `outline`.

### Standard

![Labelled diagram of ns-timeline](@assets/components/ns-timeline-event/guidance.webp)

#### Key

| Key | Field type | Guidelines |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| <span class="marker">A</span> | Icon | The icon decoration for that particular event. This can change depending on status. Refer [Status table](#event-status) below. |
| <span class="marker">B</span> | Heading | The recommended length is between 4 and 12 words, not exceeding 50 characters in total. |
| <span class="marker">C</span> | Status | Status is also shown by colour and form of the interconnecting lines and circles in the timeline. E.g. In Progress is 'information blue' and has larger roundels and icons that are solid. Whereas Pending uses a grey outline and is smaller. Refer [Status table](#event-status) below. |
| <span class="marker">D</span> | Additional content | Add further information relevant to this step to aid customer understanding, or if an action is required. |
| <span class="marker">E</span> | Completed status timestamp | Events that have been successfully completed, there is the option to display a time-stamp alongside the status. |

### Event Status

Each event has a status. The status of the event is controlled by the decoration used.

| Decoration | Status | Description |
| :--- | :------ | :------ |
| ![pending](@assets/components/ns-timeline-event/status-pending.webp)| `pending` | Communicates that the event has yet to commence. |
| ![in progress](@assets/components/ns-timeline-event/status-in-progress.webp) | `inprogress` | Indicates that progress is currently being made on this step. |
| ![success](@assets/components/ns-timeline-event/status-completed.webp) | `completed` | The event has been successfully completed. |
| ![action required](@assets/components/ns-timeline-event/status-action-required.webp) | `actionrequired` | This is used when a customer needs to take action in order to proceed with the process. |
| ![warning](@assets/components/ns-timeline-event/status-warning.webp) | `warning` | Informs of a problem with low severity such as foreseeable delays or outages etc. The problem is expected to be automatically resolved as the situation changes. |
| ![error](@assets/components/ns-timeline-event/status-error.webp) | `error` | This is a failure indication. Something couldn't be resolved and so has halted the whole process marking other `inprogress`\ `pending` event(s) `cancelled`. It should be accompanied by a helpful message. |
| ![cancelled](@assets/components/ns-timeline-event/status-cancelled.webp)| `cancelled` | Communicates that the event has been cancelled because of the error in any `inprogress` events. |


### Icons & numerals

There are 3 styles of timeline to choose from in the 'overview decorations' - default, icon, or number.

#### Default

Uses a circle and implies nothing other than it is an event.

#### Icons

These can be selected from a list to help convey meaning for each event and make it easier to identify a step. If selected, all events will need an icon chosen from the list.

#### Numbers

For use when an order should be shown.

Some icons are special and automatically reserved for use only with a particular status, such as Complete tick, Action required arrow, Warning triangle, and Error diamond. These show on all the types of 'overview decoration'.

## Implementation

### Placement

<Placement name={componentName} />

### Specification

<Specification name={componentName} />

#### Specification notes

##### `status`

The `status` attribute should not be added when `<ns-timeline-event>` is placed in `<ns-timeline>` `step` type.
