## Overview

<CompDetails name={componentName} />

The `ns-download` component creates the visual and semantics of the action of downloading an asset, as opposed to navigation. It can be used singularly or as a list of downloads for multiple files.

### Examples

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Standard">
    <ExampleViewer type="standard" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="URL without filetype">
    <ExampleViewer type="standard-url-without-filetype" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="List">
    <ExampleViewer type="list" disableConfigure />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Guidance

:::do
- Use it for all downloads.
- Include file size.
- Describe what the file is.
- Place in a list element with the class `download-list` when you have more than one download link in a row.
- Consider limiting the amount of downloads in a list to a manageable amount to ease choice.
:::

:::dont
- Use the instructions in the body, e.g. 'Download here'.
- Describe the file as a 'file'.
- Use as an inline element.
- Mix downloads amongst text types of [`<ns-cta>`](/components/ns-cta).

#### Key

| Key | Field type | Guidelines |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| <span class="marker">A</span> | File description | Provide a description of what the file is and or contains. |
| <span class="marker">B</span> | File type | The component will pick the file type from the file (if it isn't a format supported by the component, you need to provide a file type attribute). |
| <span class="marker">C</span> | File size | Accurate file size in whichever unit that makes the most sense: B, kB, MB, GB. |

## Implementation

### Placement

<Placement name={componentName} />

### Specification

#### Specification notes

##### File type

If the `href` attribute contains one of the following file extensions: .pdf, .xls, then the `file-type` attribute will have no effect.
