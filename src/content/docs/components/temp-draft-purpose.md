# Draft: 'Purpose'

## ns-accordion

> Use accordions to expand and collapse multiple sections of content.

We use accordions to break down content into meaningful sections, helping to reduce information overload. Accordions can be useful for things like frequently asked questions or displaying multiple blocks of related content inside an ns-expander.

## ns-alert

> Use alerts to communicate contextual messages to customers.

**Important:** This component has an ARIA role of `alert`, which immediately brings the content to the user's attention. Use it for its role and not for its look.

## ns-appointment-picker

> Use the appointment-picker for selecting date and time slots for an appointment.

The appointment-picker comprises a calendar component to select a date and a radio-button type inputter to show the available time slots for the selected date.

## ns-article

ns-article has been designed to be used to house content for a variety of long-form content such as blogs, editorials and support articles. Each use of the ns-article should be split into easy to consume chapters or sections.


## ns-card

> Card enables users to expand and collapse multiple sections of content.

We use accordions to break down content into meaningful sections, helping to reduce information overload. Accordions are useful for things like frequently asked questions or displaying multiple blocks of related content inside an ns-expander.
