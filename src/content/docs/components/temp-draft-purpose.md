# Draft: 'Purpose'

## ns-accordion

> Use accordions to expand and collapse multiple sections of content.

We use accordions to break down content into meaningful sections, helping to reduce information overload. Accordions can be useful for things like frequently asked questions or displaying multiple blocks of related content inside an ns-expander.

## ns-alert

> Use alerts to communicate contextual messages to customers.

**Important:** This component has an ARIA role of `alert`, which immediately brings the content to the user's attention. Use it for its role and not for its look.

## ns-appointment-picker

> Use the appointment-picker for selecting date and time slots for an appointment.

The appointment-picker comprises a calendar  to select a date and a radio-button type inputter to show the available time slots for the selected date.

## ns-article

> Use the ns-article component to display long-form content.
**Note:** This component is currently under review for deprecation.

The ns-article component is a container for long-form content such as blogs, editorials and support articles.  Use it to split the content into easy-to-consume chapters or sections.

## ns-card

> Use cards to contain content in a consistent and structured way.

Cards are to be used to apply a container around a related grouping of information. Achieve this through a combination of imagery, illustrations and typography.

## ns-caveat

> Use caveats to provide additional information and legal details to the content.

Caveats link to content on the page, providing more information about legality and eligibility by separating it to the bottom of the page.

## ns-column

> Use columns to bring flexibility and control to responsive layouts.

Allows the user interface to split into multiple columns by defining the number of columns required at specific viewports.

**Note:** Use for arranging components and content, not for gratuitous numerous columns as perhaps seen in a newspaper or magazine.
