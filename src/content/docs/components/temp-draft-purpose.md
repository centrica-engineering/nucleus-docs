# Draft: 'Purpose'

## ns-accordion

> Use accordions to expand and collapse multiple sections of content.

We use accordions to break down content into meaningful sections, helping to reduce information overload. Accordions can be useful for things like frequently asked questions or displaying multiple blocks of related content inside an ns-expander.

## ns-alert

> Use alerts to communicate contextual messages to customers.

**Important:** This component has an ARIA role of `alert`, which immediately brings the content to the user's attention. Use it for its role and not for its look.

## ns-appointment-picker

> Use the appointment-picker for selecting date and time slots for an appointment.

The appointment-picker comprises a calendar  to select a date and a radio-button type inputter to show the available time slots for the selected date.

## ns-article

> Use the ns-article component to display long-form content.
**Note:** This component is currently under review for deprecation.

The ns-article component is a container for long-form content such as blogs, editorials and support articles.  Use it to split the content into easy-to-consume chapters or sections.
