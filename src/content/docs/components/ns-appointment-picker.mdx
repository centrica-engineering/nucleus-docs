## Overview

<CompDetails name={componentName} />

The appointment-picker comprises a calendar to select a date and a radio-button type inputter to show the available time slots for the selected date.

### Examples

<ExampleViewer type="standard" />

## Guidance

:::do
- Use this when the customer needs to select a date and a time slot for an appointment.
- Use `ns-inputter` to surface the best suitable slots for a customer before presenting the full appointment picker, where appropriate.
- Use `ns-alert` alongside `ns-appointment-picker` to surface any important notifications regarding a customer booking.
- Use multiple appointment pickers in ns-tabs so users can easily access different types of bookings.
:::

:::dont
- Use to select an appointment slot on a single date. Use `ns-inputter` radio options instead.
- Force customers to use the appointment picker first if there is very poor appointment availability. Present the next available appointments in an `ns-inputter` radio first.

#### `slot-data`

The `slot-data` attribute (`slotData` property) should consist of array of objects containing a `date` and a `slots` property.

date: String - eg. 2020-01-28 (28th January 2020).
slots: Array of objects with a name and value pair.

```js
const slots = [
  {
    name: "9am to 12pm",
    value: "0900-1200",
  },
  {
    name: "10am to 2pm",
    value: "1000-1400",
  },
  {
    name: "12am to 5pm",
    value: "1200-1700",
  },
];

const slotData = [
  { date: "2020-01-28", slots: slots },
  { date: "2020-01-29", slots: slots },
];
```
