## Overview

<CompDetails name={componentName} />

The appointment-picker comprises a calendar to select a date and a radio-button type inputter to show the available time slots for the selected date.

### Examples

<ExampleViewer type="standard" />

## Guidance

:::do
- Use it when the customer needs to select a date and a time slot for an appointment.
- Use [`<ns-inputter>`](/components/ns-inputter) to surface the best suitable slots for a customer before presenting the full appointment picker, where appropriate.
- Use [`<ns-alert>`](/components/ns-alert) alongside `<ns-appointment-picker>` to surface any important notifications regarding a customer booking.
- Use multiple appointment pickers in [`<ns-tabs>`](/components/ns-tabs) so users can easily access different types of bookings.
:::

:::dont
- Use it to select an appointment slot on a single date - use [`<ns-inputter>`](/components/ns-inputter#most-common-input-types) `radio` options instead.
- Force customers to use the appointment picker first if there is very little availability. Present the next available appointments in a [`<ns-inputter>`](/components/ns-inputter#most-common-input-types) `radio` first.

#### `slot-data`

The `slot-data` attribute (`slotData` property) should consist of array of objects containing a `date` and a `slots` property.

date: String - eg. 2020-01-28 (28th January 2020).
slots: Array of objects with a name and value pair.

```js
const slots = [
  {
    name: "9am to 12pm",
    value: "0900-1200",
  },
  {
    name: "10am to 2pm",
    value: "1000-1400",
  },
  {
    name: "12am to 5pm",
    value: "1200-1700",
  },
];

const slotData = [
  { date: "2020-01-28", slots: slots },
  { date: "2020-01-29", slots: slots },
];
```
