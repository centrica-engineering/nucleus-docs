## Overview

<CompDetails name={componentName} />

It provides an area to place a layout, add an optional decoration and apply the appropriate margins. There can be more than one `ns-panel` on a page.

:::updated
**12 December 2024**

Additional feature for the `ns-panel` has been added:

- The `inset` attribute will provide a different layout, where the panel doesn't go edge to edge, but rather shows a container with rounded corners.

Check those options in [the specification](#specification) down below!
:::


### Examples

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Standard">
    The standard panel, goes from the browser's edge to edge
    <ExampleViewer type="standard" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Inset">
   To break the page's rythm and flow, the inset panel is contained and has margins on each side.
    <ExampleViewer type="inset" />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>  

## Guidance

:::do
- Use the `decoration` to separate the content visually.
- Use an appropriate colour for the purpose of the page.
- Use `inset` panels to change the flow of a page, and put the highlight on a piece of content
:::

:::dont
- Nest a `ns-panel` within another `ns-panel`.
- Use `inset` panels to create alternate cards

#### Key

| Key | Field type | Guidelines |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| <span class="marker">A</span> | Decoration | Choose between a no-colour background (default) or one of the [decoration options](#specification-attribute-decoration). |
| <span class="marker">B</span> | Anonymous slot | Items placed in the anonymous slot can include a variety of different types of content and components. |
| <span class="marker">C</span> | Inset | The `inset` attribute gives the panel a container that is not going edge to edge, for this reason, be mindful of the size and type of content that goes in this kind of panel, specially at smaller viewport sizes. |
