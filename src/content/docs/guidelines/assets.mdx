## Icons

<div class="purpose">
Icons within the design system are used to visually represent an object or action to users.
</div>

### Decorative

Used as a visual aid for some functions, categories or actions. These are not used as a direct element of interaction themselves but can help to signify and support an action. It is recommended that these aren't used in isolation and should be accompanied by a copy to add context.

There are two types of Decorative icons to choose from – solid or outline (the default is solid). Be mindful to maintain consistency when using in groups.

### Functional

Used to show where an action needs to be taken. This includes components like buttons or controls. For instance, a button might include an arrow to give the user an indication of what will happen next or a download icon to show that the user will receive something by pressing it.

## Images

### Aspect ratios

There are three aspect ratios –  `1 / 1`, `4 / 3` and `16 / 9`, which we use in various ways. Take a considered approach and do not overload with too many variants.

### Responsive rules

For all three aspect ratios, there is a rule that all images scale proportionally to their ratio. It means they will retain their shape from large screens to small ones.

The aspect ratios always scale proportionally. If it is a full-width image, the largest width shall be 1440px.

### Placeholders

These placeholder images can help visualise the image proportions and determine a focal point and ideal file size. It is recommended to utilise the .webp image format for optimal quality and size.
