## Overview

<div class="purpose">
There are six styles of list using three different HTML markup techniques –  unordered lists, ordered lists and description lists.
</div>

Visit the Content Guidance section of a Component page to find out which types of content can be included.

## Unordered lists

There are three styles of Unordered list – the familiar bullet style list and two decorative styles.

Use the Unordered list element `<ul>` as the parent element and a List item `<li>` for each line.

### Bullet list
`class="ul-bullet"`

Bullet lists can be nested up to four levels deep.
<ExampleViewer type="bullet" />

### Decorative list
Decorative lists display different bullet styles. These comprise a ticked list and a crossed list.

#### Ticked list
`class="ul-ticked"`
<ExampleViewer type="ticked" />

#### Crossed list
`class="ul-crossed"`
<ExampleViewer type="crossed" />

#### Accessibility considerations
When using these Decorative lists to represent services or features that are either available or not available, it's important to present this list with a heading identifying this.

Screenreaders and assistive technologies will see a Decorative list as either an unordered list `<ul>` or an ordered list `<ol>`. The style of the bullet does not convey meaning to assistive technology – this could be very misleading and confusing, which is why a heading is so important.

Ensure that the heading level is correct. For example, use an `<h3>`, not an `<h4>` if the previous heading is an `<h2>`. Heading levels should only increase by one.

## Ordered lists

An ordered list is used when the order is important or if there's a need to identify or refer to an individual list item within a list.

Use the Ordered list element `<ol>` as the parent element and a List item `<li>` for each line.

### Numbered list
`class="ol-numbered"`

Numbered lists will display an incremental number alongside each list item. A Numbered list can be nested up to four levels deep.
<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Standard">
    <ExampleViewer type="numbered" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Start index">
    `start="xx"`
    <ExampleViewer type="numbered-start" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Reversed">
    `reversed`
    <ExampleViewer type="numbered-reversed" />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Description list
Displaying data alongside its accompanying label is accomplished using the Description list element `<dl>` and its children `<dt>` and `<dd>` wrapped in a `<div>`.

There are two types of Description list – `dl-row` and `dl-stack`.

### Description list row
`class="dl-row"`
<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Short Content">
    <ExampleViewer type="dl-row-short" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Long Content">
    <ExampleViewer type="dl-row-long" />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Description list stack
`class="dl-stack"`
<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Short Content">
    <ExampleViewer type="dl-stack-short" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Long Content">
    <ExampleViewer type="dl-stack-long" />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
