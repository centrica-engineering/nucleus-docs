## Typeface

<div class="purpose">
The British Gas font is a typeface unique to British Gas. It has a clear, legible and elegant style.
</div>

A fallback to sans-serif is present to allow the operating system to provide the substitute.

## Weights

There are two weights of British Gas; Medium or Body.

Both of these weights are to be used to ensure variety through our content and messaging, in turn enabling us to create visual clarity, pace and hierarchy.

This helps the user to highlight different details and make sure legibility and readability are prominent in all our communications.

## Semantics vs. styles

The definitions covered here refer to typographic styles. It's important to understand the separation of styles and semantics:

- The semantics of a page inform the hierarchy and relationships, making text logically structured for screen readers and other assistive technologies.
- Styles are used to ensure optimal readability and legibility, as well as convey brand.

Without semantically correct HTML, content won't be accessible. Consider, for example, the following guidance on headings:

- The page headings must follow an order, starting from H1 to H6.
- A page must only have one H1 element.
- Ensure heading levels are sequential: H1, H2 then H3. Not H1, H3 then H2.

It is possible to style each heading. A suitable style may be applied on each of these headings. To avoid confusion, the following should be remembered:

- Refer to H1, H2, etc. only when it comes to semantic choices and accessibility.
- Use Nucleus naming conventions to discuss typographic style choices.
