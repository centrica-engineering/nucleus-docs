## Viewports

A viewport is the visible area of a web page typically determined by the size of the device's display or browser window.

It's important to understand the foundational responsive behaviour of the layouts required, for all device types and sizes.

The narrowest width of a smartphone tends to be 320px and the widest desktop can be more than 2560px.
