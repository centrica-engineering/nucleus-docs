## Nucleus

<ReleaseNotes version="1.18.0" date="29/02/2024">
<h4>New components</h4>
<ul>
<li>First, we released ns-column, to open up support for more column options, and we'll start with a 4-columns layout! Stay tuned for more options.
Very excited to release this one: ns-slot-picker it's the last piece of something big to come... a complete appointment selector.
ns-slot-picker + ns-calendar = ns-appointment-selector</li>
</ul>
<h4>Improvement</h4>
<ul><li>
We have chosen the winner of the testimonial A/B test. The winning version is the card version, and the loser is the flat version. This is now available as of today!
We added bubbles to the manual-address event on nsx-address-selector
</li></ul>
<h4>Bug fixes</h4>
<ul><li>The lockjaw version of ns-lockup had its layout breaking when the image failed to load.... well not anymore!
The values passed by the experience pattern nsx-marketing-consent were not consistent with the API, they now speak the same language.
There was an issue when firing multiple change events for radio buttons and checkboxes in ns-inputter... no more.</li></ul>
