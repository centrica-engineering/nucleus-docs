# Brand

The [Brand site](https://centrica.frontify.com/d/nfz7xmW4vrF9) shares the British Gas brand story, with supporting guidance and assets.

In order to realise this brand vision.

* Taking in brand and accessibility guidelines.
* Working with product teams to identify proven assets and related insights.
* Looking for the shared, unifying concepts behind these.
* Creating and curating high-quality user interface components and styles for product teams to use.
* Establishing processes and tools that enable us to roll out updates to these assets easily.
* Introducing ways for others to contribute to Nucleus, as well as flag any potential issues.
* Following up on our adoption and impact.
* Ensuring our communication is clear and usable for the product teams.
* Building a community to sustain these processes.

We aim to make it easier for individuals and teams to learn about what it takes to create British Gas digital experiences.

* Truly represent our brand identity across our digital, customer-facing solutions.
* Reduce repetitive work, especially when it comes to design and front end development.
* Reduce design and maintenance debt that tends to slow down updates.
* Enable teams to focus on high value, creative work to solve problems and identify opportunities.
