## Introduction

> `ns-appointment-picker` is used to select a date and time slot for an appointment.

`ns-appointment-picker` is used to select a date and time slot for an appointment. The component is comprised of an `ns-calendar` to pick the date, and an `ns-inputter` to show the available time slots for the selected date.


## Best practice

| ðŸ’š Do's | ðŸ’” Don'ts |
| :--- | :--- |
| Use this when the customer needs to select a date and a time slot for an appointment | Use to select an appointment slot on a single date. Use `ns-inputter` radio options instead |
| Use `ns-inputter` to surface the best suitable slots for a customer before presenting the full appointment picker, where appropriate. | Don't force customers to use the appointment picker first if there is very poor appointment availability. Present the next available appointments in an `ns-inputter` radio first. |
| Use `ns-alert` alongside `ns-appointment-picker` to surface any important notifications regarding a customer booking.| |
| Use multiple appointment pickers in ns-tabs so users can easily access different types of bookings.| |
