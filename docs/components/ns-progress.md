## Introduction

> A Progress component is used to indicate how far through a journey a user is and how many steps they have left to complete.

A progress component consists of a step count (eg. Step 1 of 3), an optional 'Info' heading statement, a stepped horizontal bar and track indicating the progress made and the step a user is on, and an optional 'Next' comment to predict the next step. It also has a 'Completed' status.

The progress component can be manipulated in the DOM without the need to reload the component. This dynamic behaviour enhances the user experience and facilitates the following experiences:

* Updating after user input
* Using in combination with other components such as previous and next cta's
* Skipping steps
* Going back to previous steps
* Automatically proceeding to the next step by itself until completed
* Create "rest" steps that automatically proceed after checking details, generating quotes, etc

| Key | Field type | Guidelines |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| A | Step Count | This text informs you of the current step you are on and how many steps there are in total.    |
| B | Info | This is a heading statement about this particular step. It is optional.    |
| C | Bar | This represents the current step and those that have been already been completed. They overlay the track.    |
| D | Track | This represents each step there is in in the process in total. Up to 20 steps are permitted.    |
| E | Next | A statement of what the following step will be.  It is optional.    |
| F | Completed | The status shown on completion of the journey.    |



## Best practice

| ðŸ’š Do's | ðŸ’” Don'ts |
| :--- | :--- |
| Use to indicate progress of journey | Use to show anything else such as loading |
| Info and Next parts should show a statement describing the step | Use questions on Info and Next - keep it informative |
| Keep Info and Next statements concise or omit if unnecessary or duplicating content | Omit one step but not the rest for Info - instead use an 'all or nothing approach'  |
| Keep steps to a minimum for perceived simplicity | Nest as sub-process |
| Use up to 20 steps but ideally not more than 10 | Use less than 2 steps |
| Use decimal places to reduce the number of overall steps | Use more than 1 on a page |
| Use JavaScript to dynamically update the component rather than re-add on each page | Use the last step as the confirmation page |
| Use the completed state on the confirmation page |  |

## Browser support

Internet Explorer 11 and Microsoft Edge 18 and lower do not show the progress bar.
