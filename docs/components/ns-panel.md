## Introduction

`ns-panel` is an empty container that holds each section of a page. Each `ns-panel` provides an area to place a layout and add an optional decoration.

Adding a decoration to an `ns-panel` using a gradient background provides visual separation from the other sections of the page and introduces brand [colour](foundations/colours.md) and style. Using the circle decoration provides subtle emphasis to an `ns-panel`.

## Best practice

| üíö Do's | üíî Don'ts |
| :--- | :--- |
| Use decoration to visually separate content | Add decoration to an `ns-panel` where the previous `ns-panel` has a decoration |
| Use appropriate colour for the purpose of page in decorations | Nest a panel in a panel |
| Include more than one layout in a `ns-panel` |  |

### Considerations of best practice

* Treat each `ns-panel` as a section of the page.
* Include no more than two `ns-lockups` in one `ns-panel` with a decoration.
* Layout is either a class of [`.splish` \| `.splash`] or an `ns-lockup`.

## Usage

<Storybook story="ns-panel--splash"></Storybook>

## Component relationship

|  **Relationship**  |  |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Does it live in a panel?** | ‚ùå No |
| **Does it live inside other components?** |  ‚úÖ Yes -  `ns-caveat` `ns-landmark` |
| **What layout classes can be used?**  | None |

## Specification

| Attribute | Type | Default | Options | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |-------------|
| `decoration` | `string` |  | `circle-yellow-left`, `circle-yellow-right`, `circle-green-left`, `circle-green-right`, `invert-concave-cyan`, `invert-concave-grey-light`, `invert-concave-green-light`, `invert-concave-yellow`, `invert-concave-blue`, `invert-bridge-cyan`, `invert-bridge-grey-light`, `invert-bridge-green-light`, `invert-bridge-yellow`, `invert-bridge-blue` | Decoration for the background, including the colour. |
| `type` | `string` | `panel` | `panel`, `nav` | The variant of the panel. |

| Slots | Type |
| :--- | :--- |
| `anonymous` | `div`, `ns-lockup` |

## Specification notes

* `ns-panel` is **always** a child of the `<main>` element.

### Decoration

* Check the [gradient](foundations/colours.md#our-gradients) palette.

### Anonymous

* The first child is the layout child, which should always be a `div` except when adding a lockup component.

* The layout classes are:

  * `splash` - this should be used almost always.
  * `splish ` - used for `<ns-card type="section">`.
  * `splosh`.
