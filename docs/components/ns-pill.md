## Introduction

> A pill is a small coloured highlight which can be used to draw a customer's attention to a piece of information.

Pills can be used to highlight a small item of key information to a customer. Within the British Gas experience, they should be used to attract attention to a promotional message or a notification. They should only be used to display a small detail of content and are not intended to contain lengthy or complex information.  

Pills can help to create a subtle sense of urgency or to draw a customerâ€™s attention to the value of a product or service. For example, they can be used to highlight the date that a promotional offer expires, or to feature a gift offer.

## Content guidance

![Pill](images/ns-pill/content-guidance.webp)

| Key | Field type | Guidelines |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| A | Icon | Use an icon to support your description. |
| B | Content | Content should be very concise and catchy, ideally between 1 and 4 words. Your content should not run over one line on a `squash-court` viewport. |
| C | Caveat | Use a link to a caveat. (See [ns-caveat](ns-caveat.md)) |

**Tip:** Short and snappy content that can be quickly absorbed at a glance has been shown to perform better than longer promotional content.  

## Best practice

| ðŸ’š Do's | ðŸ’” Don'ts |
| :---  | :---  |
| Use solid versions of icons | Use as validation messages |
| Use `ns-pill` very sparingly, ideally one or two per journey maximum. Less is more. | Create a shouty experience by using `ns-pill` in multiple places. It dilutes the impact.  |
| Use a `yellow` pill to draw attention to an offer or promotional message. | Create distraction or put undue pressure on customers to purchase unwanted or irrelevant products by overusing urgency elements. |
| Use `red` and `lime` pills for dashboard notifications.  | Donâ€™t use pills near a text CTA. Pills should not detract attention from your usersâ€™ next action. |
| Keep your copy short and simple for maximum impact. | Use in the middle of a sentence |
| Use `ns-pill` in a component with a direct CTA | Use the `ns-pill` as a link or button. (Caveat link excepted). |
| Choose colours that are consistent and relevant | Use icons that can make `ns-pill` visually appear like an interactive component, for example an `ns-cta` or drop-down `ns-inputter/select`. |
|  | Use `ns-pill` as a heading |

### Considerations of best practice

#### Multiple pills

Multiple pills within a journey will create a distracting and overwhelming experience for users. Please read our guidelines below carefully and use this component sparingly.

#### Colour usage

Colour should be used consistently with pills throughout the customer journey.  

A `yellow` pill is used to draw attention to an offer of promotional message.  

A `red` or `lime` pill can be used to drawing attention to important customer information or notification. For example, within a dashboard context, `red` can be used to indicate an â€˜expiredâ€™ item and `lime` to indicate a â€˜newâ€™ item or `forest` for â€˜successâ€™.

There are a range of colours to choose from (see the specifications below). Try to use those that are consistent with existing usage, and relevant to subject (eg. Orange for Hive products).
