## Introduction

The product card overview is an experience pattern that can be used to compare HomeCare products against each other and see the difference in price when choosing to have an excess or not - without having to reload the entire page.

## Content guidance
Wrap the overview component in `ns-panel` and use its `decoration` attribute for decoration. It is possible to use any [decoration](ns-panel#specification) for ns-panel. However we recommend to use **only** `invert-concave-grey-light` decoration for better accessibility of the contents inside the overview component.

```markup
<ns-panel decoration="invert-concave-grey-light">
    <nsx-product-card-overview></nsx-product-card-overview>
</ns-panel>
```

### With Excess
When `excess` property of the overview component is set with an array of price options, the excess prices are displayed as radio options in the overview component. When a user selects a radio option, an `excess-change` event is dispatched from the overview component. The consuming wrapper component has to listen for the event and sets the updated ns-product-card prices back in the `pricing` attribute of the component.

#### Usage

```markup
<nsx-product-card-overview excess="[60,0]" pricing='[{"monthly": 1200,"annually": 14400,"excess": 90}]' priceheading="Estimated Price"></nsx-product-card-overview>
```
