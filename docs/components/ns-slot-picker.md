## Introduction

> Ns-slot-picker is used to allow the user to select a time slot from one or more dates and time slots.

Ns-slot-picker is used any time you want a customer to select a time slot. This would typically be used for booking an appointment. It can display time slots for a single day or multiple days. It can be used on it's own or upfront before displaying ns-appointment-picker. It is also used in [ns-appointment-picker](components/ns-appointment-picker.md).

## Best practice

| üíö Do's | üíî Don'ts |

| Use this when the customer needs to select a specific appointment slot from a known selection of dates | Use this when there are many (more than 5) dates to choose from, use ns-appointment-picker |
| Use this to present a number of suitable slots upfront to a customer |  |
| Use this to help a customer find the soonest available appointment time when there is poor appointment availability |  |
