# nsx-footer

## Introduction

The footer holds legally required links and copyright information for the website. It is also an important SEO tool as it includes links to social channels and our mobile apps.

This experience pattern is a wrapper of the `ns-footer`. The footer experience pattern is broken into 3 parts. Legal links, SEO links and brand and copyright notice.

If a link needs to be updated for the website footer, it needs to be done in this experience pattern.

## Best practice

| 💚 Do's | 💔 Don'ts |
| :--- | :--- |
| Keep it at the bottom of the page as the last element. | Make your own footer if you are part of the customer facing website. |
| Keep the footer outside the `main` element |  |
