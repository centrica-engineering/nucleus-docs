## Introduction

> Expanders are used to show or hide content.

An expander consists of a heading and a anonymous content slot.  When the heading is clicked the component opens to reveal the content. When in an open state, clicking the heading will hide the content.

## Content guidance

![Expander - Being used in an Accordion](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45626534/75039379-7315b080-54b0-11ea-9816-8b679a290a19.png)

| Key | Field type | Guidelines |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| A | Heading | This is the heading to the anonymous content. When the heading is clicked the component opens to reveal the content.   |
| B | Content | Expander can accommodate multiple paragraph slots, these should be concise, using sub-headings to split large paragraphs. Can contain bold copy `<b>`, inline links `<a>`, and lists `<ul>` `<ol>`. |

## Best practice

| 💚 Do's | 💔 Don'ts |
| :--- | :--- |
| Use instead of modal | Use to hide important information (such as caveats) |
| Use headings, paragraphs, lists for content | Use as a solution to excessive copy on a page |
| Make sure heading relates to content | Nest expanders within expanders |
| Use a coloured expander to draw attention to a promotion in an expander on a product card | Use multiple coloured expanders on one page |
|  | Use a coloured expander to draw attention to a warning message. Use ns-highlighter or ns-skyline instead. |

## Usage

<Storybook story="ns-expander--expander"></Storybook>
