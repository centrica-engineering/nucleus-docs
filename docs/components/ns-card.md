## Introduction

> Cards can be used to contain content in a consistent and structured way.

Cards are used to apply a container around a related grouping of information; this can be done through imagery, illustrations and typography.

## Content guidance

### Section Card

![Card - Section](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45626534/74165461-0c290980-4c1d-11ea-89df-19f2784178e1.png)

| Key | Field type | Guidelines |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| A | Heading | The recommended length is between 4 and 12 words, not exceeding 50 characters in total. Headings contain light and bold font weight to highlight key messaging. |
| B | Content | A single, short paragraph works best. You are able to use inline text links within the paragraph if necessary. Don't add additional headings within the paragraph and the copy length should not exceed more than two paragraphs of 3 lines each. Can contain bold copy `<b>`, inline links `<a>`, lists `<ul>` `<ol>`, and a caveat at the end of the relevant paragraph if required `<a href="#caveat">1</a>`. |
| C | CTA | Keep the text â€˜short, relevant, and actionableâ€™. It should not exceed more than 24 characters. |
| D | Illustration | Use to support and highlight the content. The illustration should relate to the product or service you are talking about. The [specification table](#specification) has a list of options. |

### Support Image Card

| Key | Field type | Guidelines |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| A | Heading | The recommended length is between 4 and 12 words, not exceeding 50 characters in total. Headings contain light and bold font weight to highlight key messaging. |
| B | Content | A single, short paragraph works best. You are able to use inline text links within the paragraph if necessary. Don't add additional headings within the paragraph and the copy length should not exceed more than two paragraphs of 3 lines each. Can contain bold copy `<b>`, inline links `<a>`, lists `<ul>` `<ol>`, and a caveat at the end of the relevant paragraph if required `<a href="#caveat">1</a>`. |
| C | CTA | Keep the text â€˜short, relevant, and actionableâ€™. It should not exceed more than 24 characters. |
| D | Image | This is the image that will be used above the ns-card. It should have an aspect ratio of 16:9, the dimensions should be 640x360px, the file type should be jpg, and the file size should be no more than 50kb. Don't use imagery with white backgrounds. |

### Image guidance

| Component | Variant | Ratio | Dimensions | Size | Type | Placeholder |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `ns-card`| `support` | 16:9 | 640x360px | &lt; 50kb | jpeg | [ns-card-support-640x360px](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50207859/67642149-d3c91e00-f900-11e9-983c-9b812217b801.jpg) |

## Best practice

| ðŸ’š Do's | ðŸ’” Don'ts |
| :--- | :--- |
| Always use them in the triple layout | Use the text CTA in the section card |
| Use to direct customers to the actions | Mix card types in a row |
| Embolden text in the paragraph that is important | Have two or more cta's for a card |
| Make your CTA copy unique, stating the action | Repeat the CTA copy in each card |
| Use section cards to navigate users to primary actions | Use inline links in the paragraph |
| Consider using decoration in the panel to add emphasis on the cards | Use the section card without a decoration |

### Considerations of best practice

* Consider your CTA type and try to keep them consistent between rows across the cards, unless there is a need.
* There can be less than three cards in a row, but it should always use the triple layout. Always consider a lockup for this, before using the cards.
* Headings work best with one to four words.
* Please check the imagery guidelines when adding an image to the card.
* Be careful when using decoration in the panel with the section cards as the blue on blue with the CTA's will make them not accessible.
* There should always be a heading to the group of cards inside the panel.

## Usage

### Section

<Storybook story="components-ns-card--section"></Storybook>

### Using with action

```markup
<ns-card type="support" decoration="bulb">
  <h3 slot="heading">Get energy with us</h3>
  <p slot="paragraph">We've got a tariff to suit every home and family.</p>
  <div slot="action">
    <!-- action content ns-cta/ns-form -->
  </div>
</ns-card>
```

### Using with ns-pill

To add a `ns-pill` to the card it needs to be placed inside the `heading` slot. This allows screen readers to announce the pill when they are navigating by headings on a page.

```markup
<ns-card>
  <h3 slot="heading">
    <ns-pill>Special Offer</ns-pill>
    Get energy with us
  </h3>
  ...
</ns-card>
```

If using with a a type of `support` there is also the option to place the pill over the image using the `pillOverImage` attribute. Note the `ns-pill` will still need to be in the `heading` slot.

```markup
<ns-card type="support" image="path/to/image" pillOverImage>
  <h3 slot="heading">
    <ns-pill>Special Offer</ns-pill>
    Get energy with us
  </h3>
  ...
</ns-card>
```

More details on how to use the ns-pill can be found on the [ns-pill documentation](components/ns-pill.md)
