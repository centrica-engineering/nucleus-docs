## Introduction

> Marketing consent is the capture of a customer's contact preferences for marketing purposes.

This experience pattern should be used in any journey where customer marketing preferences are captured.

This component is only used to capture and submit customer preferences, not view or change existing preferences.

## Content guidance

It is possible to change the heading and the first paragraph to suit specific context. However, we recommend using the default content as these have been signed off by the legal team.

If there is an official update to the default content, please inform Nucleus so that the the component can be updated.

## Best practice

This component is legally required when capturing contact preferences that will be used for marketing purposes.
