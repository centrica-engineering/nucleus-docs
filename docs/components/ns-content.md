## Introduction

> ns-content is used to display typography and media.

`ns-content` is used inside other components and has been created to help add consistency to typography styling, and to improve how typography interacts with other components.

## Content guidance

We do not currently have content guidance as this will change depending on the context in which it's being used.

## Best practice

ns-content relies on clean HTML in order to display correctly. Avoid using additional `<div>` tags to wrap content as this will break the styling.

## Usage

<Storybook story="components-ns-content--standard"></Storybook>

## Component placement

<ComponentPlacement component="ns-content" parentComponents="ns-panel,ns-article,ns-expander,ns-card,ns-form"></ComponentPlacement>

## Specification

| Slots | Type |
| :--- | :--- |
| anonymous | html content |

<Tokens component="content"></Tokens>
