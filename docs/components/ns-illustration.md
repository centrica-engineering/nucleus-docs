## Introduction

> Illustrations are visual symbols used to bring the warmth of British Gas brand and personality to the website.

Illustrations simplify products and services to users in a friendly manner. Illustrations always accompany content.

## Best practice

| ðŸ’š Do's | ðŸ’” Don'ts |
| :--- | :--- |
| Use them to convey depth | Make the illustrations small |
| Use them to differentiate or define the content | Use on their own as the primary visual element |
| Use them to help signpost | Use instead of icons |
| Check existing usage | Alter the colours or apply visual effects |


### Considerations of best practices

When choosing an illustration from the available set in Nucleus, it should be relevant to the content. Each has a descriptive name to help aid selection. (See Usage below).

Avoid unnecessary duplication of an illustration on a page. Be aware of existing usage elsewhere.

## Usage

<StorybookStory story="components-ns-illustration--standard"></StorybookStory>

## Component placement

The ns-illustration component can be used in a number of components to help create bespoke user interfaces (UIs).

## Creating new illustrations

If you are looking to create a new illustration, please check if there is not something similar already in use. If there is no suitable option, liaise with the brand team to define a new one and let us know so we can help with the required specification for adding it to the design system.

Read our [illustration foundation page](foundations/illustrations.md#creating-new-illustrations) for more information on creating illustrations.
