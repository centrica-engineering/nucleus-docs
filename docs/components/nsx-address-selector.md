## Introduction

The address selector is a multi-functional experience pattern that can be used for any one of, or a combination of, the following tasks:

* searching for a specific address by postcode
* adding or entering a new address
* amending an existing address
* selecting an address from a list of existing premises (e.g. multi-premise landlords)

## Usage Examples

### Markup

```markup
<nsx-address-selector postcode="AA12 3BB" addresses="arrayOfAddresses" allow-manual-address></nsx-address-selector>
```
### Anonymous customer

If the address selector hasnâ€™t been provided with any addresses, it will start by asking for the customer to enter their postcode.

You can [see the anonymous state of `<nsx-address-selector>` here](https://main--63ea3fa8c3721b415537bccc.chromatic.com/?path=/story/experiences-nsx-address-selector--anonymous-address).

When the customer enters a postcode, the component will dispatch a `postcode-selected` event.  At this point the component shows a `loading` state until it is provided with a list of addresses.

### Multiple addresses

When you set the `addresses` property of the component it will change state to display the addresses and ask the customer to select one.

### Many addresses

If there are 6 or more addresses then the component will display the addresses in a select drop-down.

### Manual address

If the customer chooses to make changes to their address, they can use the **"Amend your address"** CTA, this will then display the manual entry address form. 

When displaying this form the `manualformenabled` property to set to `true`. You can manually enable this property if required.

## Component placement

<ComponentPlacement component="nsx-address-selector" parentComponents="ns-form"></ComponentPlacement>

## Specification

| Attribute | Property | Type | Default | Options | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `addresses` | `addresses` | `array` | `[]` |  | The list of addresses that will be displayed to the user |

### Addresses

Each address in the addresses array should be an object consisting of the following propeties: `addressLine1`, `addressLine2`, `postalTown`, `county`, `postcode`, `label`.  

The `label` is what will be displayed in the address list UI.

#### Markup

`{ addressLine1: '123 Kings Road', addressLine2: 'Little Village', postalTown: 'Townsville', county: 'Surrey', postcode: 'AA12 3BB', label: '123 Kings Road, AA12 3BB'}`
