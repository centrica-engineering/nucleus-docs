## Introduction

> The form component is used to contain ns-inputters and manage their validations.

The `ns-form` component is a wrapper for `ns-inputters`. It's main purpose is to manage the validations of these `ns-inputters`.

## Best practises

| ðŸ’š Do's | ðŸ’” Don'ts |
| :--- | :--- |
| Use `ns-inputter` for your form fields | Write your own validations |
| Use `ns-cta` to submit your form | Rely on front end validation alone. |

### Considerations of best practises

* Alyways use the `ns-inputter` component inside `ns-form`, input and other form elements shouldn't be on their own.
* Speak with the Nucleus team for advice on experience patterns.

## Usage

<Storybook story="form-components-ns-form--multi-input-form"></Storybook>

## Component placement

<ComponentPlacement component="ns-form" parentComponents="ns-panel,ns-card"></ComponentPlacement>

## Specification

| Attribute | Type | Default | Options | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `validate` | `function`  |  |  | Validates all of the fields within the form and returns an object containing the field and validation data |

| Event | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `submit` | Dispatched when the user tries to submit a form. |
| `validated` | Will pass the object of the fields and validation when validate is called. |

## Specification notes

### Submit

The submit event is triggered in one of two ways:

* Clicking on ns-cta (without href attribute)
* Pressing enter when focused on an input

Exceptions:

* Nested ns-forms will not dispatch the submit event to a parent ns-form
* The nsx-address selector will dispatch a submit event as it is a self contained experience.


#### Handling submit events

You will need to set up a way to listen for the submit event. This can be done using via `onsubmit` or using an event listener.

The returned event contains `event.detail.submitter` - this is the element that triggered the ns-form submit.

Note: submitting the form does not trigger validation, this will need to be handled separately. See Validated below.

onsubmit example:

```markup
<ns-form onsubmit="submittedForm(event)">
  <ns-inputter validation='["isRequired"]'>
    ...
  </ns-inputter>
  <ns-cta>Submit</ns-cta>
</ns-form>

<script>
  function submittedForm(event) {
    // do something as a result of the event

    // validate the form
    event.target.validate();
  }
</script>
```

### Validated

* This is only required if you need to listen for an event. The `validate` attribute will pass back the same object.

#### Validation data

An **invalid validate return response** looks like:

```javascript
{
  "isValid": false,
  "fields": [
    {
      "name": "email-address",
      "isValid": false,
      "value": "",
      "error": "This field is required",
      "input": {}
    },
    {
      "name": "password",
      "isValid": false,
      "value": "",
      "error": "This field is required",
      "input": {}
    }
  ],
  "fieldsByName": {
    "email-address": {
      "name": "email-address",
      "isValid": false,
      "value": "",
      "error": "This field is required",
      "input": {}
    },
    "password": {
      "name": "password",
      "isValid": false,
      "value": "",
      "error": "This field is required",
      "input": {}
    }
  }
}
```

A **valid validate return response** looks like:

```javascript
{
  "isValid": true,
  "fields": [
    {
      "name": "email-address",
      "isValid": true,
      "value": "hello@example.com",
      "input": {}
    },
    {
      "name": "password",
      "isValid": true,
      "value": "password12",
      "input": {}
    }
  ],
  "fieldsByName": {
    "email-address": {
      "name": "email-address",
      "isValid": true,
      "value": "hello@example.com",
      "input": {}
    },
    "password": {
      "name": "password",
      "isValid": true,
      "value": "password12",
      "input": {}
    }
  }
}
```
