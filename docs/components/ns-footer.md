## Introduction

> Required links and information that need to be repeated on every page.

> NOTE: This is the UI component for producing a customised footer. If you are looking for the default British Gas footer which contains the links please use `nsx-footer`.

The last component on the page, this holds links and copyright notices that are legally required.
It also holds information about the company.

## Best practice

| ðŸ’š Do's | ðŸ’” Don'ts |
| :--- | :--- |
| Always have the footer at the bottom of the page. | Make your own footer if you are part of the customer facing website. |
| Keep the footer outside the `main` element |  |

### Considerations of best practice

* If you are using the footer add a `id` with the value `footer` to work with skip links

## Usage

<StorybookStory story="components-ns-footer--standard"></StorybookStory>

## Component placement

<ComponentPlacement component="ns-footer"></ComponentPlacement>
