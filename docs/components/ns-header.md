## Introduction

> Primary navigation for the website

The header provides the primary navigation for the website, whilst also being our main brand presence with the logo.

> NOTE: This is the UI component for the header - if you are looking for the header with the navigational content please use `nsx-header`.

The default choice of header across the main British Gas UK home site should be the nsx-header.

## Best practice

| üíö Do's | üíî Don'ts |
| :--- | :--- |
| Create your own header if you are a micro site or external partner | Make your own header if you are part of the customer facing website. |
| Follow the correct structure for the navigation links | Add personalisation links into the navigation, as this can have an SEO issue. |
| Have a header on every page | Load links from an API of external source as this has a performance impact. |
|  | Add the header inside the `main` element. |

### Considerations of best practice

* There needs to be a very good reason to use this component instead of `nsx-header`.
* If changing the logo - use an SVG. Make sure that the SVG has been compressed.
* Logo can only have a max height of `62px` i.e. the British Gas logo is 160px x 62px

## Usage

<Storybook story="components-ns-header--standard"></Storybook>

## Specification notes

### Logo

* Only change if the header will be used in a non British Gas journey, for example a partnership with Bord Gais.
* Remember to give a new `alt` value.
* Logo can only have a max height of `62px` i.e. the British Gas logo is 160px x 62px.
* Hosting of the logo should be within our own systems not pointing to an outside resource.

### Alt

* This is the alt for the logo, so should be the company name.

### Hide links

* Add this attribute when there is no navigational links (when there is nothing in the anonymous slot).

### Dynamic link slot

* This is a dynamic slot.
* This must follow a flat DOM structure of just an anchor tag.
* The suffix of the slot corresponds to the the `data-link` attribute value on the link you want to take over.
* The link should be given text content and should correlate to what the link text content was previously.

### Primary structure

This is an array of each navigation section. Each navigation section is an object.

Each section:

* `heading`
* `href`
* `subheading`
  * `heading`
  * `links`
    * `text`
    * `href`
    * `data-link`

```json
[
    {
      "heading": "Energy",
      "href": "/energy.html",
      "subheadings": [
        {
          "heading": "Gas & electricity",
          "links": [
            {
              "text": "Gas & electricity services",
              "href": "/energy.html"
            },
            {
              "text": "Our gas & electricity tariffs",
              "href": "/energy/gas-and-electricity.html"
            },
            {
              "text": "Get a quote",
              "href": "/GetAQuote/"
            },
            {
              "text": "Connections for new builds",
              "href": "/energy/gas-and-electricity/new-connections.html"
            },
            {
              "text": "Warm Home Discount",
              "href": "/energy/energy-saving/warm-home-discount.html"
            }
          ]
        },
        ...
      ]
    },
    ...
```

### Secondary navigation structure

```json
[
  {
    "text": "Help & Support",
    "href": "/help-and-support"
  }
]
```

<Tokens component="header"></Tokens>
