It's important to understand the foundational responsive behaviour of the layouts required, for all device types and sizes.

The narrowest width of a smartphone tends to be 320px and the widest desktop can be in excess of 2560px. A difference which equates to a 700% increase in width!

## Sizes

Using a modular scale of 2:3 (1.5) and setting our minimum viewport size to be 320px; we use the formula _320 * 1.5<sup>x</sup>_ to calculate our viewports.

Taking a device independent approach to deciding on the widths to design to in order to illustrate how a design could adapt at different sizes, we start small and use a modular scale of 1.5 resulting:


| Size | Viewport | Column | Offset |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| üîµ Squash court | 320px (_x=0_) | 288px | 16px |
| üéæ Tennis court | 480px (_x=1_) | 432px | 24px |
| üèÄ Basketball court | 720px (_x=2_) | 648px | 36px |
| üèë Hockey pitch | 1080px (_x=3_) | 972px | 54px |
| ‚öΩ Football pitch | 1270px (_x=3.4_) | 1143px | 63.5px |
| üèâ Rugby pitch | 1620px (_x=4_) | 1458px | 81px |
| üëï Polo field | 2430px (_x=5_) | 1600px | 415px |

## Viewport

Using a modular scale of 1:5, starting at the narrowest (popular) smartphone viewport of 320px width and maintaining a fluid approach using one single percentage value across all viewports (90%) to provide us with the Column and Offset.

## Football pitch

As much as possible we like to keep the value of _x_ to whole numbers; this makes the viewport changes predictable and easy to work with.

However, we discovered that the range of hockey pitch was too broad, this meant there were a variety of layout issues, which included squashed and overflowing content at the narrower end (1080px), and stretched components at the wider end (1619px).

Football pitch was introduced to reduce these layout issues.
### Column

Our Column width is determined by setting the left and right Offset to be 5%.

* The maximum width of our Column is 1600px.

### Offset

The offset refers to the space to the left and right of the Column taking up 5% of the width of the viewport each side. At 320px the Offset is 16px.
