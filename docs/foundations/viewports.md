It's important to understand the foundational responsive behaviour of the layouts required, for all device types and sizes.

The narrowest width of a smartphone tends to be 320px and the widest desktop can be in excess of 2560px. A difference which equates to a 700% increase in width!

## Sizes

Using a modular scale of 2:3 (1.5) and setting our minimum viewport size to be 320px; we use the formula _320 * 1.5<sup>x</sup>_ to calculate our viewports.

Taking a device independent approach to deciding on the widths to design to in order to illustrate how a design could adapt at different sizes, we start small and use a modular scale of 1.5 resulting:

| Size | Viewport | Column | Offset |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| üîµ Squash court | 320px (_x=0_) | 288px | 16px |
| üéæ Tennis court | 480px (_x=1_) | 432px | 24px |
| üèÄ Basketball court | 720px (_x=2_) | 648px | 36px |
| üèë Hockey pitch | 1080px (_x=3_) | 972px | 54px |
| ‚öΩ Football pitch | 1270px (_x=3.4_) | 1143px | 63.5px |
| üèâ Rugby pitch | 1620px (_x=4_) | 1458px | 81px |
| üëï Polo field | 2430px (_x=5_) | 1600px | 415px |

## Viewport

Using a modular scale of 1:5, starting at the narrowest (popular) smartphone viewport of 320px width and maintaining a fluid approach using one single percentage value across all viewports (90%) to provide us with the Column and Offset.

## Football pitch

As much as possible we like to keep the value of _x_ to whole numbers; this makes the viewport changes predictable and easy to work with.

However, we discovered that the range of hockey pitch was too broad, this meant there were a variety of layout issues, which included squashed and overflowing content at the narrower end (1080px), and stretched components at the wider end (1619px).

Football pitch was introduced to reduce these layout issues.

### Column

Our Column width is determined by setting the left and right Offset to be 5%.

* The maximum width of our Column is 1600px.

### Offset

The offset refers to the space to the left and right of the Column taking up 5% of the width of the viewport each side. At 320px the Offset is 16px.

### Figma library

Our Figma UI Kit library uses just the two most commonly used viewports (based on our analytics). A set of components have been designed for each, labelled as 'Narrow' and 'Wide' ‚Äì these equate to 'Squash court' and 'Hockey pitch' sizes, typically a small mobile and a small laptop size. The Figma components align with our coded components (the single source of truth, as found in Storybook) and are correct for how they appear or and responsively transformed at those viewport sizes. The Figma components have been constructed to emulate the same options and behaviour as closely as possible whilst being able to accommodate varied content.

The Nucleus British Gas Figma UI Kit library is published and consumed online through Figma and updates are released in the same way. If you need access to it you will need to request to be added to the Figma British Gas organisation workgroup.
