title: Working agreement
description: How we approach work between the Nucleus team and the community
---

> A set of working principles agreed between the teams using the Design System and the core Nucleus team.



### We act as one design community
As a design/UX community, we understand the context and decisions made before. We work collaboratively to evolve these as the context and needs change over time.

### We prioritise in-person collaboration
We recognise that working in person adds a layer of shared understanding and brings down silos. It helps us all work in similar ways so that we build empathy, visibility, and cross-learning.

### We involve each other as early as possible
We recognise that involving each other from the beginning on a piece of work prevents wasting time, leads to better outcomes, and delivers value to our customers faster.

### We aim to improve continually
Everything we create has a proven added value. We aim to better our customers' experience with every release.

### We measure, capture, and celebrate the impact of our work
We understand the outcome of the changes we make, so we can repeat successes and avoid mistakes in the future.

### Everything we do is visible and available to all
We aim to make everything understandable, and open to the community.

### Everything we make is inclusive
Everything we create is usable by anyone and leaves no one behind.

### Every experience we create solves a problem
Everything we do is linked to a user's need â€“ a problem that has been identified and verified.

### We have fun together!
When possible, we meet for fun events such as hackathons, meetups, conferences or just a night out to get to know each other better.
