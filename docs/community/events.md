## 2020-06-03 / Squad achievement session
For the fifth time Nucleus presented at the internal squad achievements session. It was packed full of achievements from the last 2 months. The presentation was split into 3 areas:

* What have we done?
Some of the highlights from the last two months including, the `nsx-footer`, `ns-testimonial` variants & date picker testing (and more).
* What are we doing?
We introduced the work we've been undertaking around Nucleus usage data, the 2 new Page types available in our documentation and discussed HTML prototype support.
* What's next?
On the horizon are functional journey patterns, redesigning the header and dedicating resource to helping teams implement the Nucleus.

## 2019-12-04 / Squad achievement session
This was the second opportunity for the Nucleus team to present to the BG Home digital team. On this occasion we focused on celebrating the success the other teams are having using the design system.

In the first part of the presentation we covered:

* The content of our newest release, including the new components now available.
* Updated headline metrics showing the progress the everyone is making.
* Examples of product journeys & guide pages reaping the benefits of Nucleus.
* Different types of user testing that‚Äôs been conducted over the last 4 weeks using Nucleus as the basis of the design.
* Success stories in our ways of working with other teams.
* Finally, we finished the fist part with a preview of what‚Äôs coming in our next release.

As a bonus we introduced the team to the topic of systems thinking. This was intended to get the team thinking more about the ‚Äòsystem‚Äô aspect of a design system, and hopefully dispel the myth that it's all about design!

The final message was a nudge to get teams to think about how their requirements fit in with other products and journeys (i.e. as part of the system), and we provided some example questions they to use in order to be more 'system focused' when raising requests for change to the design system.

## 2019-11-06 / Squad achievement session

This was the first of the monthly Squad Achievements sessions. We gave a presentation to the whole UK home digital team. Focused on introducing what Nucleus is and why we have a design system as a company.

The presentation talked through the following points;

  * An introduction to the team and our roles.
  * We explained what a design system is, and more importantly what it‚Äôs not.
  * We talked through the main advantages of the design system including: efficiency, consistency, code quality and accessibility.
  * We then discussed how we make this happen as a team on a day to day basis.
  * We also highlighted the current pressure on the design community being the sole advocates of Nucleus in each team. We made the point that everyone in each team has a role to play.
  * Finishing off by congratulating everyone on how far we have come but reinforced the point that we still have a long way to go.

The audience had the opportunity to ask questions via slack after the event. We will add a link to the questions and our responses here as soon as they are up.
