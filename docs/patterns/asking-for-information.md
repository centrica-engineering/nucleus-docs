## Introduction

Asking for information plays a key part in our customersâ€™ experience with British Gas. All functional journeys include elements of data capture and asking a customer to make a choice. Grouping questions, information, and choices together in logical and relatable sections can make our experiences as intuitive as possible.

## Framing your content

The `lakeside` variant of the `ns-landmark`, is ideal for introducing and framing your pages. It is non-decorative, therefore reducing the distraction. It supports a sub-heading and heading, along with a single paragraph. You can use this to signpost the journey, and frame the context of the information you are asking the customer for.  

**Further research:** We are currently researching the use of `legends` and `labels` as headings, with the view that you would not need to use an `ns-landmark` to start each page.

## `ns-form`

The `ns-form` component is a wrapper used to contain all your form controls. Itâ€™s primary purpose within the design system is to manage the validations of your form controls. Semantically it sits at the top of the hierarchy.

## `ns-fieldset`

The `ns-fieldset` component is an element that sits directly in an `ns-form`. We use the fieldset to help group form controls such as inputs, radios, and checkboxes. Within the `fieldset` there is a `legend` element - this can help describe the form controls and provide context to the customer. 

It is unnecessary to use the `fieldset` and `legend` when presenting the customer with a single input field relating to one piece of information.

## Grouping your questions

As expressed in the [journey patterns documentation](patterns/journeys.md) we advise that you approach each functional journey in the same way - breaking down the journey into smaller sections, asking the customer a single question or group of questions at a time. The idea is to reduce the cognitive load and help a customer complete what they need to do as efficiently as possible.

### Group by theme

Grouping questions together thematically can help a customer understand the context and objective of what you are asking. 

### Group by type of control

Radio buttons and checkboxes should be grouped in their own respective fieldsets. The legend should be used to provide context to the choice(s) a customer is being asked to make. Each form control should use their own label as the answer. 

## Text inputs

The `ns-inputter` component is a multi-purpose wrapper component for displaying form controls such as text inputs, radio buttons, and checkboxes. The component has a number of features that allow for things such as validation, masking, and formatting.

### Common types of information

The `ns-inputter` component is capable of supporting the following common types of information you might ask a customer for:

- Names
- Telephone numbers
- Email addresses

### Complex types of information

Along with these, you can use a combination of validation, mask, and separator to ask the customer for more complex information such as:

- Meter reads
- Sort codes
- Reference numbers

**Further research:** We are currently developing pattern documentation for the use of these patterns, by doing this we look to ensure that there is a consistent approach to asking customers for this information across customer journeys.

## Radio buttons and checkboxes

These are extremely common form control elements used to ask customers to make choices from a small list of options, or to answer simple yes/no questions, or to toggle a single option on or off. 

Radio buttons and checkboxes are automatically grouped together in a `<fieldset>`. For accessibility, the `heading` attribute found on the `ns-inputter` must be used to provide a `<legend>` to describe the options. These are usually in the form of a question - such as "Are you a British Gas customer?" or "Which British Gas services would you like to choose?".
