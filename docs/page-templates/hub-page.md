# 📕 Hub Page 

## Introduction

Hub pages are designed to link other pages (often product pages) and navigate users down the right path. That means hub pages contain lots of links and snippets of information. They’re essential site navigation tools, but they can also be powerful SEO tools. We know existing customers often use hub pages to navigate to their end goal.

- Guide existing customers to the best action, since many of them use hub pages as a starting point rather than logging in.
